Ethans partially correct solution to the coding challenge

```java
public static int changeBy(String S)
  {

    //this is default OUTPUT. You can change it.
    int result = 0;

    //write your Logic here:
    int[] charOrder = new int[26];
    int a = (int) 'a';

    for(int i=0; i<26; i++){
      charOrder[i] = (i+a);
    }

    for(int i=0; i<S.length(); i++){
      if((int)S.charAt(i) != charOrder[i]){
        result++;
      }
    }

    return result;
  }
```

# Spring Boot Actuator

Spring Boot Actuator is a Spring Library that exposes tools for monitoring and gathering metrics about a running application

You can utilize Actuators defined endpoints to view different information about your application

- /health: shows the health of the application
- /beans: shoes the list of available beans in the BeanFactory/ApplicationContext
- /env: return the current application properties
- /info: returns general information/data
- /logfile: return the content of the logfile
- /loggers: show/modify logger configurations
- /mapping: show all @RequestMappings
- /metrics: show metric info about the application
- /shutdown: shutdown the application

In the application.properties you turn on or off the specific endpoints you want

# Using RestTemplates to consume web services

RestTemplate is used to make web requests/http requests with Java/Spring applications

RestTemplate acts as a webclient to make requests to other webservices, it offers three different methods of exchanging data with a webservice

- getForEntity()
- getForObject()
- exchange()

# Microservice Architecture Overview

## What are Microservices

Microservices are small, autonmous services that work together

In microservice architecture, we divide the application into services. Each service does specific business logic, and has its own database

You are essentially creating multiple Java applications, (don't all have to be java application) that serve a particular purpose, then each one of these communicates with one another to create a more complicated system

![MSA-Arch](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--Rwy8QdS98U/YUL06RNoSbI/AAAAAAAAC6I/y_lvUT1ZARITSGeeCrX28YFvygIHjtMrQCLcBGAsYHQ/s790/microservices1.jpg)

Microservice architecture gives us a more decrentralized approach for building software, which also scales well, and has greater agility

Netflix popularized microservice architecture, and created their own API to handle their microservices, these were used by developer everywhere, but have slowly been phased out by newer apis (Spring Cloud)

## Characteristics and Challenges of MSA

Characteristics of MSA:

- Break up our application into multiple individually deployable components, should be independently replaceble and upgradable
- Services should be organized by business logic
- Provides infrastructure automation with continuous delivery and automated testing
- Service should be isolated, failure of one service should not take down the entire app

Challenges:

- Finding concrete boundries between services
- Finding the root cause of a bug
- Version management
- Logging has be distributed between services
- An issue caused by one service could propagate to other services

## Advantages vs Disadvantages

Advantages:
- MSA follow the Single Responisibility Principle
- Fault Isolation: If once service, the rest of the system should be able to continue operating
- Microservices are language and platform independent
- Dynamic Scaling - we can dynamically scale up and down each service whenever we need, we can also spin up more services if we need
- Developers have the freedom to develop and deploy services independently
- Use of containers of allowing for quick deployment and development of the application

Disadvantages:
- MSA is quite complex
- Harder to test and monitor because of the complexity
- Large numbers of microservices are harder to manage and secure

## MSA vs Monolithic

| Monolithic                                                                                                        | MSA                                                                                                                                        |

| Code changes affect the entire system.                                                                            | Only the microservice that is changed would be affected.                                                                                   |
| One codebase and one shared database.                                                                             | A codebase and database for each microservice.                                                                                             |
| Hard to scale or upgrade.                                                                                         | Easy to scale and upgrade.                                                                                                                 |

| Monolithic uses a shared database.                                                                                | Each microservice uses a single database. Each service can use any database system (MySQL, Oracle, NoSQL) depending on its business logic. |
| Monolithic applications are tightly coupled. Here, it is difficult to change technology or language or framework. | MSA ensures that the services are loosely coupled, so it's easy to make changes since services are independent to each other.              |
| The entire system can be affected by a single error or bug.                                                       | The entire system is shielded from the error or bug on one microservice.                                                                   |

# MSA Architecture Components

## API Gateway

The API Gateway sits between the client and the collection of services

It essentially routes the clients request to the correct service

It acts as a single entry point to the application

## Discovery Service

Service Discovery is a method for different services to locate one another, the service registery is a key part of the discovery service

Service Registry:
- Holds network locations of services in the system
- Contains currently available instances of each service with connection details
- The services query the service registry to retrieve details about the services in the system
- Check to see if the services are still running

## Load Balancing

In MSA multiple instances of each service may/will be deployed for availability and scalibility, this limits the failure of a single instance

To manage all of these instances you use a load balancing mechanism to ensure that incoming requests are spread across all available instances

A load balancer acts as a traffic cop sitting in front of our server and routes clients requests across all servers capable of filling those requests

There are two kinds of load balancing:

Server Side: a server side application that tracks all the requests coming in and distributes them between instances
- AWS Elastic Load Balancer

Client Sice: information is made aware to the client about the options for which instance service to query. The client decides where to go
- Ribbon, part of the netflix stack, is a client-side load balancer built straigh into Spring Cloud Gateway

## Circuit Breaker

Circuit breaking is used to prevent a network, or service failure from cascading to other services

A circuit breaker wraps a function call with a monitor where the monitor will be tracking potentional failures. If the service is in the failed state, the circuit will send the error message without making a call (to the failed service). If the service is up, then the break forwards the call to the service

Circuit breaker has three states:

1. Closed State: when the service is up and running, the circuit remains closed and calls pass through to the service

2. Open State: when the number of failures exceed a predetermined threshold the breaker trips, then goes into the open state. The open state of the circuit breaker will return an error message for all calls to the service without making an actual call to the instance

3. Half-open State: The circuit breaker will make some trial calls to the failed service periodically. This it is to check to see if it is running again, if it is, the circuit breaker will close, if it is still unresponsive, the circuit will stay open.

## Messaging Queues

A message queue is a software component used for passing data between services. It exposes an interface for adding, reading, and removing message

They facilitate asynchronous communication between services

Messaging queues use producers and consumers
- Producers creates and publishes messages to the queue
- Consumers read/consumer those messages from the queue


We have two messaging models

- Point-to-point: the producer is called the sender, the consumer is called reveiever
    - Sends and receives messages through a queue
    - Each message is received by only on receiver
    - Messages are ordered
- Pub/Sub: allows a message producer to broadcast a message to one or more consumers
    - The producers are called publishers, and they public messages to a queue called a topic
    - The consumers are called subscribers, and they can subscribe to topics to consume messages

## Pub/Sub Use cases:

Pub/sub is very common with MSA to orchestrate things like:
- Realtime event distribution
- Replicating data among databases
- Parallel processing and workflows
- Enterprise event bus
- Datastreaming from IoT devices
- Refreshing distributed caches
- Loading for reliability

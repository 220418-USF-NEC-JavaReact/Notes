## Data Manipulation Language

Used to change data inside of the database/table
- Often refered to as the CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
    - This is the theoretical construct of the mininum you should be able to do with a table in SQL
- Syntax/Keywords for DML:
    - INSERT: add data into the table
    - SELECT: retrieve data from the table
    - UPDATE: used to update data in the table
    - DELETE: useed to remove data from the table

# Introduction to JDBC

Java Database Connectivity, allows us to write Java code to interact with relational databases

## JDBC Classes and Interfaces

There are several classes and interfaces commonly used with JDBC, which can be found in java.sql package and javax.slq package

- `DriverManager` class - to make a connection with a database driver
- `Datasource` interface - an alternative to the DriverManager
- `Connection` interface which represents a connection to the database
- `SQLException` class: a general exception that is thrown when something goes wrong
- `Statement` interface used to execute SQL statements
- `PreparedStatements` interface used to execute a precompiled SQL statement
- `CallableStatement` interfaced used to execture a stored procedure on the database
- `ResultSet` interface that represents the data returned from the database

## Connection Interface

To create a connection, you use the DriverManager.getConnection() method, with these paremeters
- URL to the database (jdbc:postgresql://hostname:port/databasename)
- username
- password

## Statements and ResultSets

We use Statements to setup/start our transactions with the database in Java

We use ResultSets to return the data from the database, to get a ResultSet object, you execute the Statement you created with a SQL string

You must manually loop through the result set data to create the java objects yourself

## Setting up the Database Driver and a Connection

To establish a connection to the database, you will need what is known as a driver
- These are database specific
- You can get them through the maven repository
- We will need the postgres driver

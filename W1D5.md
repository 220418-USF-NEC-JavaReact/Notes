# IDE's

Are Integrated Development Environments, which create a nice working area for developers

For Java there are many including, Eclipse, STS, Intellij and more, we will be using intellij because thats what the client wants

## Installing a Linter SonarLint on Intellij

Sonar Lint is a free, open source linting tool. A linting tool/linter is a software tool which, when integretated with an IDE can provide increased feedback to the developer

Traditional IDE tool utilize built in linters to indentify code syntax errors, and exceptions, but Sonar Lint provides further suggestions by recognizing code smells

## Code Quality Analysis and Code Smells

Code Quality Analysis tools are programs specifically designed to expose errors as well as code smells

Code Smells:
- Vulnerabilities
    - Data security issues
- Bugs
    - Issues with the functionality of code
- Maintainability
    - Confusing or hard to maintain code
    - Repeated instances of code
    - Unused imports
    - Empty code blocks
    - Unaddressed autmated code comments

Intellij also allows you to install it directly in the IDE which is what I will be doing

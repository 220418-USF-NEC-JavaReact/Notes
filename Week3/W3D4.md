# AJAX (Asynchronous Javascript and XML)

the process of exchangin data from a webserver asynchronously with the help of HTML, CSS, and Javascript

- We use it to load data from a server, and selectively update some part of our webpage without reloading
- Uses the browsers built in XMLHttpRequest Object (XHR) to send and receive data from webservices asynchonously

The AJAX Workflow

1. A client event occurs on the webpage
2. Javscript will create the XMLHttpRequest object
3. The XHR makes an async request to the server
4. The server processes the request
5. The server create a response and send the data back to the client
6. The browser processes thje returned data using Javascript
7. The page content is updated with the data using Javascript

There are 4 steps to creating an AJAX Request

1. Create the XHR object with `new XMLHttpRequest()`
2. Set the readystatechange callback function
3. Use the `.open(method, url, async)` method of the XHR object to open the connection to the server
    - method is a string specifying the type of request (POST, GET, PUT,...)
4. Use the `.send()` method to send the request to the server to be processed

The server then sends back a response which can be processed, this is returned in the form of:
- responseText: the response as a string
- responseXML: the response as XML
- status: the status code for the response
- statusText: text representation of the status code

We make use of the XHR's property readyState and its function onreadystatechange to watch for when the response is ready to use

The readyState has 5 states
- 0: it is not initalized
- 1: the connection has been established
- 2: request was recieved by the server
- 3: server is proccessing the request
- 4: request is finished, and response is ready

You can also set the function onreadystatechange to some custom function to handle the response once our readyState is 4
- The onreadystatechange function gets called every time the state changes in the XHR object

# Working with JSON in AJAX

The XHR object can only send string in a request, however, we can still send JSON thanks to Javascripts functionality

Convert Json to a string with JSON.stringify()

Convert the string response to a javascript object with JSON.parse()

# Fetch API

fetch is a more modern way to send http requests from your browser via JS

It is provided by the window object and it povides the `.fetch()` method

- `.fetch()` is used to send requests and returns a promise that is retrieved from the response
- Successful requests get resolved, and the returned promise will have the response body
- Requests that return an error status code will be rejected

There are various methods you can use to access the body of the a successful response:

- `response.text()`: read the response and return as text
- `response.json()`: read the response and return as json
- `response.formData()`: return the response as form data
- `response.blob()`: return the respone as binary data with type
- `response.arrayBuffer()`: return the resonse as an arrayBuffer (low level representation of binary data)

# Promises

Javascript uses promises for async operations, they are placeholders for a future value. Many asyn functions will implicitly return promises

Promises in Javascript are objects, and you can create one if you wanted with the new keyword

Promises take a callback function called executor, this automatically runs when the object is created
- The executor also takes in two callback functions
    - `resolve(value)` this runs and returns whatever value if the promise is succesful
    - `reject(error)` this runs and returns an error when the promise is not successful

Promises also have a property called `status` which gives us information about the state of the object. The promise can be in one of three states:
- pending
- fulfilled
- rejected

The promise objects connects the executor and any consuming functions which will receive the result or the error from the promise

You would use `.then()` `.catch()` and `.finally()` to consume the data from the promise, and chain different consumer functions

# async/await

Introduced in ES8 to simplify asynchronous functionality

The async keyword denotes that a function will operate asynchronously via the event loop

- Any function with async keyword will implicitly return a promise object
- YOu can use any of the consumer functions on the return of an async function, however there is a much nicer way to handle these

The await key, this only works inside of async functions

- await tells Javascript to wait for a promise to resolve before moving on
- You can use await when calling a function that returns a promise, but it must be inside of an async function
- It allows you to gather data, or wait for something while also not blocking the thread

# Session Management Continued:

Cookies are key-value pairs of information sent by the server to the client which the client stores
- they you can send the cookie back in an HTTP request header

The servlet can then check for the presence of the cooke, most likely get session information

There are two types of cookies:
- Non-persistent: a cookie that expires after the user closes the browser
- Persistent: a cookie that only expires after the user logs out/the server gets rid of it

To setup a cookie you simply use `document.cookie = cookie`

We need to be careful what we store inside of the cookies, because attacker can use cross site scripting to get information out of them

# OWASP - Broken Authentication (Identification and Authentication Failure)

When you allow your users to access yout web application with proper credentials

If you application is not built properly an attacker can do malicous things to gain access to the web application including:

- Credential Stuffing: an attacker knows a list of usernames/passwords and stuffs then into the usern and password fields with reckless abondon hoping to gain access to app
- Automated attacks: random usernames and passwords will be stuffed into the web application over and over until something works
- Default passwords: assume you have a new machine, and the default username and password is admin/password, the attacker could try a bunch of usernames and password like this

## How to prevent these attacks

Multifactor authencitation: Two step logins are definitely painful when it comes to logging in, but are becoming an essential security tool.

Password Complexity: when users create their passwords, they are forced to use more complex passwords, further lessening the change their password is in a massive list of passwords

Failed Login Attempts: Setup a way to lock an account if the user puts in the wrong password too many times

There are also tools such as firewalls that can supplement your application security, but usually you can avoid these by simply designing your application well, and limiting the liberties that can be taken regauding passwords

# OWASP Topic - XML External Entities

This vulnerability takes advantage of XML parsers that may parse some bad data

Your web application takes in data in the form of an XML document either through an HTTP request or form on your webpage

Sometimes these documents could contain or refer to some external entity. What this could allow is fort attacker to include some malicous payload in the XML, and if your XML parser reads, it may relase what ever attack on your application

## Some ways to prevent this

Disable XML External entities completely from your web application. Do need it? Disable for all the parts of the application that don't need it

Disable DTD proccessing where possible, Document type defintion, which is simply another way for web application to parse xml

Implement positive serverside input validation, check the commands being run before run them

Source code analysis tools, run tests on your source code to see if you got attacked

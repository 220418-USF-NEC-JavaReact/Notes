Week 5 Day 3 Coding Challenge Ethan's Solution

```java
    public static int ArrayMaxima(int N, int[] A){
        
        //this is default OUTPUT. You can change it.
        int result = -404;

        int minOdd = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int minEven = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

        int maxOdd = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        int maxEven = Integer.MIN_VALUE;

        //We are going to loop through the array and find the largest and smallest numbers
        for(int i=0; i<N; i++){

            int num = A[i];

            //Check for evens
            if(num % 2 == 0){

                //Check to see if our current even number is smaller than minEven
                if(num < minEven){
                    minEven = num;
                }

                //Check to see if our current even is larger than maxEven

# MVC Architecture Review

Model View Controller Design Pattern, it is a pattern that is used to design user interfaces and structure applications

Model: used to represent the business layer of the application, aka the data layer which defines the business logic of the system, and represents the state of the system
- In our case our services, daos, and models

View: the presentation layer/ui of the application. It displays data that is fetched from the model layer by the controller
- In our case our react application

Controller: the link between the view and the model, it receives user requests from the view, and talks to the model layer, returning data to display on the view
- In our case our javalin controllers, or soon to be Spring controllers

The advantage of breaking up our application like this, is that multiple developers can be working on each part independently of each other

It also enables logical grouping of realated actions on a controller together

# Spring MVC / Web

Spring MVC is a request driven structure centered around a central servlet using the front controller design pattern

Servlets are the underlying technology that allows java to interface between clients through the internet

## Front Controller Design Pattern

The front controller desgign pattern provides a single handler for all incoming requests for resource in an application, then dispatches the request to the appropriate handler for that type of request

It uses a helper api to achieve the dispatching mechanism, it is broken up into four main components

1. Front Controller: is the single entry point for all requests, and it directs requests to the dispatcher

2. Dispatcher: this is responisble for managing the actions and the views, including locating and routing to specific actions that the service the request, and finding correct views

3. Helper Classes/Controllers: are used to break up the logic for specific features, and makes the program easier to build and maintain

4. Views represent and display information that we want to display to the client

## Front Controller Design Pattern and Spring MVC

The Spring DispatchServlet is completely intregrated with the Spring IOC container

The Dispatch Servlet routes routes requests to handlers, view resolvers, and also provides support for uploading files

Since the Dispatch Servlet is a servlet itself, you would have to configure it in a web.xml

View Resolvers will retrieve the correct view from a controller for us

# InternalViewResourceResolver

Its a wrapper class for JSP or other resources within our web application

It can be used to expose model objects as request attributes and forward requests to a specified URL using the RequestDispatcher

The InternalViewResourceResolver supports definitions for InternalResourceViews for a simple and straight forward resolution for @Controller class methods

# Spring MVC Annotations

## @Controller
will mark a class as a controller, which is a special type of bean that handles requests, the dispatcher will scan for these classes, and send requests to the correct controller

## @RequestMapping
used to map a URI to a specified class, or to a specific method inside of a controller, you can also include the http method that you want to specify for a method
- Typically I will only use these over a clas, and use @GetMapping, @PostMapping, etc

## @RequestBody
used to gain access to the object sent with the request

## @ResponseBody
used to convert the return type of the method, to the correct json object to be sent back to the client
- send java objects back to the client automatically

## @RestController
a class level annotation, and it combines @RequestMapping, and @ResponseBody annotaions, and allows you to return from the class methods normally, akak you don't need to annotate every method with @ResponseBody

## Path Parameters and Query Parameters

To use a Path Parameter you will need the @PathVariable annotation

To use a Query Parameter you will need the @RequestParam annotation

These go inside of the parameter list of your controller method

We will be using Spring MVC through Spring Boot and Spring Web

# Spring Boot Introduction

Spring Boot is an open source Spring Framework project used to rapidly create Java based production grade applications, utilizing Spring Frameworks IOC and module integration

Spring Boot simplifies project creation because it allows you to pick and choose which Spring features you want, and configures them for you

Spring Boot has a built in Tomcat server, and you don't need to map and servelts for web applications

To enable auto configuration you just need to annotate your driver class with @SpringBootApplication

@SpringBootApplication is a combination of:
- @SpringBootConfiguration
- @EnableedAutoConfiguration
- @ComponentScan

You can also override/customize configurations using the application.properties file
- This is where we will be setting up our database connections
- Choosing what port we want our server running on
- Spring allows for use of Environment Variables out of the box, so we don't have to worry about leaking our database credentials

# Spring Data

### Spring Data is NOT a core spring framework

Spring Data is a family of frameworks for ORM and data persistence whos main purpose is to abstract away required logic for data storage. Allows us to focus on business logic

# Spring Data JPA

We are specifically going to be using Spring Data JPA

Spring Data JPA is a Spring Data module that you can use to implement the Java Persistence API.

It is going to help us implement our data layer extremely quickly, giving us the implementations for our DAO functionality by using simple interface method stubs

It essentially abstracts away the use of hibernate and Spring ORM, simplifying your Data Access Layer and providing standard implementations for common DAO methods

We no longer have to implement our DAO methods, they are simply provided to you by extending JpaRepository

When you extend JpaRepository Spring will automatically create an implementation for your DAO, including CRUD operations for standard data acess, as well as custom queries based off of method signatures

## Spring Data JPA Interface Hieararchy

![JPA Repository](https://www.petrikainulainen.net/wp-content/uploads/springdatajrepositories.png)

## Spring Data JPA Features

Building sophisticated repositories based on Spring and JPA

Support for QueryDSL Predicates and type safe JPA Queries
- Enables staticaly types SQL-like queries

Transparent auditing of domain classes

Pagination support

Dynamic Query Execution

Support for integration of custom data access code

Automatic Custom Queries

Validation of @Query annotated queries during bootstrapping

Support for XML based entity mapping

JavaConfig based repository configuration by introducing `@EnabledJpaRepository`

## Spring Data JPA Methods

Spring Data JPA is going to come with some predefined methods

-   https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/api/org/springframework/data/jpa/repository/JpaRepository.html
-   Primarily CRUD operations

You can also create custom method signatures to find almost anything you would need
-   https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/1.5.0.RELEASE/reference/html/jpa.repositories.html
-   Take a look at table 2.3 in the above link for examples
-   When Spring data create a new repository imnplemenation, it analyzes all of the methods in the interface, and attempts to automatically generate queries from the method names. It has its limitations but it is also very powerful and an elegant way of defining new custom access methods with very little effort

You can also use the @Query annotation to write JPA queries if you can't quite get the exact output you are looking for with the custom queries above

# Spring Data Annotations

| Annotation                      | Purpose                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| @Transactional                  | Configure how the database transaction behaves                                            |
| @NoRepositoryBean               | Creates an interface that provides common methods for child repositories                  |

# @Transactional

When we are interacting with databases through Java, we should expect that multiple transactions will be performed at the same time

With @Transactional we can allow Spring Data to manage these transactions for us to prevent issues with very little code added to our code base

@Transactional is essentially, makes Sptring treat each method inside of the class we are annotating, as a transaction, so that if an exception, or some other error occurs in the middle of a method call, all of the actions taken in the method can/will be rolled back

We can mark entire classes, or if you want individual methods

@Transactional attributes
| Attribute | Purpose |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| isolation | The transaction isolation level. |
| noRollbackFor | Defines zero (0) or more exception Classes, which must be subclasses of Throwable, indicating which exception types must not cause a transaction rollback. |
| noRollbackForClassName | Defines zero (0) or more exception names (for exceptions which must be a subclass of Throwable) indicating which exception types must not cause a transaction rollback. |
| propagation | The transaction propagation type. |
| readOnly | A boolean flag that can be set to true if the transaction is effectively read-only, allowing for corresponding optimizations at runtime. |
| rollbackFor | Defines zero (0) or more exception classes, which must be subclasses of Throwable, indicating which exception types must cause a transaction rollback. |
| rollbackForClassName | Defines zero (0) or more exception names (for exceptions which must be a subclass of Throwable), indicating which exception types must cause a transaction rollback. |
| timeout | The timeout for this transaction (in seconds). |
| transactionManager | A qualifier value for the specified transaction. |

# Transaction Propagation Strategies

When accessing databases with java, it is common to have one service method call upon another service methods, and each might create a new transaction.

These tranasction propagration strategies below, describe how spring should manage these situations

|   Strategy    | Purpose                                                                                              |
| :-----------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   Mandatory   | Support a current transaction, throw an exception if none exists.                                    |
|    Nested     | Execute within a nested transaction if a current transaction exists, behave like REQUIRED otherwise. |
|     Never     | Execute non-transactionally, throw an exception if a transaction exists.                             |
| Not Supported | Execute non-transactionally, suspend the current transaction if one exists.                          |
|   Required    | Support a current transaction, create a new one if none exists.                                      |
| Requires New  | Create a new transaction, and suspend the current transaction if one exists.                         |
|   Supports    | Support a current transaction, execute non-transactionally if none exists.                           |

# Spring Boot DevTools

Enables two useful features with Spring

- Cache Disabling: cache is helpful in production, but can hinder development, so DevTools disables it
- Automatic restarts: anytime you make a change to your application, the development server will restart

# Responsicve Web Design

the approach that allows websites to render on all devices and screen sizes by automatically adapting the screen

Done through CSS using various settings to serve different style properies based on screen size
- Done through the combination of flexible grids, flex boxes, flexible images and media queries

## Media Queries

In CSS3 support for responsicve web design was added through the use of media queries, it allows for changes in the webpage for different devices without any change in the html

A media query consists of an optional media type, and any number of media feature expressions

- You can combine multiple queries with the use of logical operators
- They are case sensitive
- You use the @media rule to incorporate it with the css block

Media Types:
- all
- print
- screen
- speech

Media features: describes the specific characheristics of use agent/output device
- grid
- height
- width
- hover
- more

Logical Operators:
- not
- and
- only

## Flex Boxes

Flex box is a one dimensionakl layout method for arranging elements in rows or columns
- It is useful for designing flexible layouts without using float or positions
- Create a flex container by setting the css property of `display` to `flex` on any element
- Any element inside of a flex container is a flex item, and will be responsive to the flex box properties

Flex box properties:
- flex-direction: used to change which direction the items will flex (row or column)
- flex-wrap: tell css how it would wrap overflow
- flex-flow: short hand combination of the two above
- justify-content: used to align content horizontally within the container
- align-items: used to align content vertically in the container

Flex items properties:
- order
- flex-grow
- flex-shrink
- flex-basis
- flex-property
- align-self

## CSS Grid

Grid is a two dimensional grid based layout system that "completely changes how we can create user interfaces"

- Grid uses a containaer, that holds rows and columns, to create the container you use `display: grid`
- You can set the rows and columns with `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows` respecively
- Like flexbox, you can use grid to dynamically rearance your ui, based on media queries, instead of writing super complex css

# Form Elements and Its Attributes

Use forms to collect data from users of the website
- Use `<form>` tag to create a new form

The form tag has the following attribute you can set:
- action: the URL to the server you are sending the information
- target: tells the webpage where to load the new page
- method: specifies which http method to use submitting

The `<input>` tags inside of the form can have the following attributes
- name: provides a label for that input
- value: allows you to specify a default for that field, and also allows you to get the value typed into that field with JS
- placeholder: allows you to specify some placeholder text for that input
- required: makes it so the user must fill out that field
- min/max: specifies a minimum or maximum value for that field

## Input Element and its Types

The input element is used to get information from the user

We have several types of inputs, that allows to get different types of input
- text: one line text input
- password: text field, which does not show the characters
- radio: buttons that only allow one selection per group
- check boxes: buttons that allow multiple selections per groups
- file select: allows the user to input a file
- textarea: a multiline text field
- select: allows a user to select from a dropdown
- reset and sumbit: these do exactly what they say

To submit a for, you can create an input of type submit, this will automatically submit the form, and reload the page (unless you override the default functionality of the form)

# HTML 5 Validate

Before sending form data we want to perform what called client validation

There are two ways of achieving this
- Javascript
- Built-in form validation

HTML5 introduced several ways to validate a form
- required: forces the user to fill out that field
- minlength and maxlength: indicates the miniumum or maximum number of character
- min and max: indicates the minimum or maximum value
- type: defines the type the data should be
- pattern: defines a pattern (regular expression) that entered data should follow

When data is verified and it satisfies the contraints, they are considered valid, and will be given a CSS psuedo class :valid which can be used to modify the look of the page if the user input is correct

The opposite is also true, if validation doesn't go through, the input will be given the CSS psuedo class of :invalid, which can also be used to modify the look of the page if the user input is not valid

# Javascript and DOM

## Javascript Overview

High-leveled
- memory management and garbage collection
- easily human readible

Interpreted
- browser is going to read the javascript code line by line

Multi-paradigmed
- supports multiple programming paradigms such as as procedural, objected oriented, and functional

Dynamically Typed
- no static type checking, no need to declare a variable type, and you can reasign a variable to any type

Single Threaded
- runs off the event loop, multi-threading is not possible

It is the most commonly uised client side spripting/programming language
- Runs on the browser
- Primilary used to create dynamic webpages
- Runtimes such as NodeJS which allow it to be run outside of the browser
- Javascript has NOTHING to do with Java

Javascript follows the specifications set out by ECMAScript

- This is where JS gets its versions
- For example some versions of JS include ES5, ES6, ES7, ES2020

## Linking your HTML and JS

HTLM supports the use of Javascript with the `<script>` tag, you can either write javascript directly inside of these tags, or you can link an external file
- Javascript written inside of the script tags is known as internal javascript
- Javascript written inside of a file is known as external javascript
- The script tag can in the head or the body blocks, but the best practice is at the end of the body

## Document Object Model (DOM):

The DOM is a web API (built into the browser) which gives Javascript access to all of the elements of the HTML page

The root of the DOM tree is the HTML tag, otherwise known as the `document` object
- Every other element inside of the HTML tag is acessible by JS via this `document` object


To gain access to the DOM, you simply use `document` keyword/object in javascript, it gives you access to methods to select elements, traverse the tree, and manipulate the html page

## JS Syntax and Variables

Syntax Rules:
- Case sensitive
- Semicolons are optional
- Spacing/white space doesn't matter
- Single and multiline comments are the as java

Javascript Variables
- Used store data/values
- Use the keyword `var`, `let`, or `const` to declare a variable
- Variables have a name and a value you assign to them, just like java
- Cannot be named a keyword, cannot start with a number or special character (execpt for `$` and `_`), and cannot contain spaces
- Literals in javascript are fixed values, aka your primitives

## JS Data Types

Javascript has 7 primitives
- string
- number
- boolean
- null
- undefined
- object
- Symbol (es6 thing)

Strings:
- Simply text enclosed by single or double quotes
- `var s = 'this is a valid string'`
- `var s = "this is also a valid string"`

Numbers:
- Can be positive and negative
- Can be decimal or non-decimal
- Include special datatypes such as infinity, NaN (Not a Number), bigInt
- `var n = 4;`
- `var n = 3.5`
- `var inf = infinity`

Boolean:
- Simple true or false
- `var f = false;`
- `var t = true;`

Null:
- Refers to nothing
- IT IS NOT THE SAME AS EMPTY STRING OR 0

Undefined:
- The variable was declared, but not initalized
- `var x;`
    - This variable was created, but it was never never defined

Objects:
- A set of key value pairs, the key is a string, and the value can be anything, inlcuding another object or an array
- You can access the objects properties using dot notation or bracket
- ```javascript
  let obj = {
      name: "Ethan",
      title: "Trainer",
      company: "Revature"
  };

  var name = obj.name;
  var title = obj[title];

  obj.company = "Microsoft";
  obj[name] = "Ethan McGill";
  ```

## Arrays in JS

Are objects which store a list of values
- Allowed to store and and all datatypes in an array
- Index start at 0
- Values can be accessed by the associated index inside of brackets
- Arrays also include a length property which indicates how many values are stored in the array
- Arrays in JS are dynamically sized, they size will automatically grow or shrink as you add items
- Arrays come with several build in methods:
    - .push()
    - .pop()
    - .foreach()
    - .filter()
    - .map()
    - .slice()

# Functional Programming in Javascript

Functional Programming is an approach to programming where the programmer break their application into "pure" functions
- A pure function is a function which evaulates a simple expression which will produce the same output every time it is called with the same input

The main purpose of functional programming is to the question of "what to solve" rather than "how to solve"

Javascript gives us the ability to this with functions

# Functions

a peice of reusable code that can be called anywere in the program
- define them using the `function` keyword, and they take in as many parameters as you like
- you can use the `return` keyword to return something from the function
- ```javascript
  function nameOfFunction(params){
      return is optional
  }
  ```

## DOM functions to Select Elements

There are several ways to select an element in the DOM tree:
- `document.getElementById("id")`: select a single element based off of its id attribute
- `document.getElementsByClassName("class")`: selects an array of elements with that classname
- `document.getElementsByTagName("tag")`: selects an array of elements that match that tag
- `docuemtn.querySelector("selector")` and `document.querySelectorAll("selector")`: select an element/s, with a specified CSS selector

## DOM Functions to and properties to Manipulate

There are several methods and properties that give you the ability to view and change the values in the element

- `document.createElement()`: you can create an element and insert it into your html page
- `element.replaceChild()`: remove an element from the DOM and replace it with another one
- `element.removeChild()`: removes an element from the DOM
- `element.insertBefore()`: insert an element to the DOM before the selected element
- `element.innerText` and `element.textContent` to change, set, or get access to the text in the element
- `element.innerHTML`: to set the HTML inside of that selected element
- `element.cloneNode()`: used to clone an element

More methods to access attributes of the element selected
- `element.getAttribute("name")`
- `element.setAttribute("attrbute")`
- `element.removeAttribute("attribute")`
- `element.hasAttribute("attribute")`

## DOM properties to traverse an HTML page

To gain access to the top most nodes:
- `document.documentElement`
- `document.head`
- `document.body`

To gain access to the parent nodes of the currently selected element
- `element.parentNode`
- `elment.parentElement`

To gain access to any sibling nodes of an element
- `element.previousElementSibling`
- `element.nextElementSibling`

To gain access to children nodes:
- `element.childNotes`
- `element.firstChild`
- `element.lastChild`

# Events and Listeners

Events occur when a user interacts with a webpage, or when the browser triggers one

You can configure the webpage to handle these events using Javascript event listeners/handlers

Some events include:
- onclick: when a user clicks on something with their mouse
- ondblclick: when a user double clicks something with their mouse
- onload: when the browser is finished loading the page
- onunload: when the browser is finished unloading the page
- onresize: an event that occurs when a user resizes the browser
- onmouseover, onmouseout, when a user moves their mouse over or out of an area
- onkeydown: when a user uses their keyboard
- onfocus: when a user clicks on an input field
- onblur: when a user clisk out of an input field
- onchange: this is a form event that occurs when a users changes a form input
- onsubmit: this is a form event that occurs when a user submits a form

These events are nothing without a handler/listener

There are three ways to create a listener

1. Inline, where you set the on... attribute of the html element to a predefined function in your js
2. You can set the event property of the html element to a predefined JS function
3. You can use the `element.addEventListener(event, function, useCapture)`

# The Event Object

In Javascript events are represented by an Event Object

Event objects have the following properties and methods:
- bubbles: a boolean which indicates the propagation method of the element
- currentTarget: a reference to the DOM element whos event listener triggered the specific event
- preventDefault(): cancel/prevent the default action of an event
- stopPropagation(): prevent the event from propagating further
- target:  a reference to the DOM element that triggered the event
- timeStamp: the time of the event in miliseconds
- type: the type of the event

## Types of Events

There are several subclasses of the Event Object, which all include their own properties as well as the properties from above

- A complete can be found here: https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/obj_events.asp

## Mouse Event

Events generated when the user interact with the webpage with their mouse

Events like onclick, onmouseenter, onmouseleave, and so on

The MouseEvent object has many properties to gain information about that event
- Coords of the mouse relative to the window: clientX, clientY
- Coords of the mouse relative to the last event: movementX, movementY
- Coords of the mouse relative to the target: offsetX, offsetY
- Coords of the mouse relative to the screen: screenX, screenY
- Whether alt, control, or shift were held when clicking: altKey, ctrlKey, and shiftKey
- Which mouse button was hit: button, buttons, which

## Keyboard Events

This is an event that gets generated when a user interact with your website with their keyboard

You would use these to add functionality to your webforms

Events onkeydown, onkeypress, onkey all create keyboard event objects

This object has the following special:
- Whether alt, control, or shift where hit: altKey, ctrlKey, shiftKey
- Which key was hit: key, keycode, and which
- Whether the key is being held down: repeat

# Programming Overview

## What is Programming

Some set of instructions for our computer to run

- Perform some specigic function

At some point we reach a point where bash scripts start getting too compilication, and we need a way to write more complicated programs

## Programming Language

We can use programming languages to write more complicated applications

These languages allow us to give the program some set of instructions for the computer to run


There are a couple different levels of programming languages
- Low level languages are closest to the way computers see data
- High level languages are closest to the way humans read/write
- There is also some inbetween languages which give the advantage of being human readible, but also give the programmer the ability to manipulate physical memory on the computer

Low to low level programming spectrum

Machine language would be the lowest level, we are talking straight to the machine

Assembly would be a little bit higher, but still not completely human readible, and you have physical memory access

C Language is the true inbetween, it has the human readibilty of high level languages, but memory access and management is still done manually

Java, C#, Python, are among the highest level of programming languages, they are very human readibil compared to low level languages, and they have features such as automatic memory management.

# Overview of Java


## What is Java

A programming language managed by Oracle, it is high leveled, strongly typed, and object oriented

## Why do we use Java?

Java is everywhere, according to StackOverflows developer survey is it the 3rd most used programming after removing HTML and SQL (are not programming)

It is relatively easy to learn, yet powerful enough to complete advanced tasks
- C based syntax, but removes many of the complexities of the C programming language

It is platform independent, you can write java code on any machine with any hardware and run it on a different machine with different hardware
- Write once run anywhere thanks to the compiler and the java virtual machine

It is high leveled, meaning the developer does not need to worry about memory management, or other hardware level tasks

It has automatic garbage collection

It is built around Object Oriented Programming priniciples, allowing for creation of classes and objects to be used throughout the program

## How do we use Java?

It must be installed, and configured on your computer

- You can do this manually, or use a program like scoop which installs and sets everything up for you
- Installation steps for scoop
	- `scoop bucket add java`
	- `scoop install lessmsi`
	- `scoop config MSIEXTRACT_USE_LESSMSI $true`
	- `scoop install ojdkbuild8-full`
- MacOS: follow the guide for home brew

Java source code lives in files denoted with .java
- Each .java file will hold one or more classes
- Java programming is centered around classes and objects


## Objects are used to model anything described as a noun in java

Objects have a name, states, and behaviors
- And objects state and behaviors will some times be refered to as class members
- The name of the object will come from its class name

## Classes layout exactly how these objects are to be created

They are like blueprints for an object in java
- We create classes to layout what our objects should contain
- Use classes to instantiate our objects

We store our objects states inside of variables, which MUST have a datatype assocaited with it


## Datatypes

Inside of our classes we instantiate variables which store some information
- Variables in Java MUST have a datatype associated with it
- Once the datatype is set, it cannot be changed

Java has two types of Datatypes

Primitives are the most basic building blocks of java code, these include numberic and character data types

| boolean | 1 bit | true or false | 
| byte | 8 bits | -128 to 127 |
| short | 16 bits | -32,768 to 32,767 |
| int | 32 bits | -2^31 to 2^31-1 |
| long | 64 bits | -2^63 to 2^63-1 |
| float | 32 bit decimal | -1.4^45 to 3.40^38 |
| double | 64 bit decimal | -4.9^329 to 1.79 ^308 |
| char | 16 bit unicode |

Referenc data types are objects that are referenced in the memory allocated to our program
- Arrays
- Strings
- Custom objects

Primitive Casting

We can change/comvert the datatype of a variable to a different datatype with casting
- Widening, can and will occur automatically in java, taking a smaller datatype and storing in one with more bits
	- This is why we must explicitly tell java we want to store bytes and shorts
- Narrowing, will again occur automatially with long, but can also be attempted with others, this is taking a datatype with more bits and storing/converting it to a datatype with less bits
	- You must be careful, you could try to store a value too large into a datatype that is smaller

Default Values of each datatype
- In java when you create a variable, if you do not explicitly give it a value right away it be instaniated with a default value
	- Numberics: 0 or 0.0
	- Boolean: false
	- char: \u0000
	- Reference/objects: null

# Java Compilation Process

Take the .java file and turn it into a JVM readible .class file
- Then the .class file is run and outputs what the program was outputting

## How do we actually compile?

With the `java` command, this turns our java code into byte code

Where is the compiler in relation to the rest of Java?

## JDK

Java Development Kit, includes developer tools
- Comiler, Debugger, other command line utilities
- These can be found in the folder where you installed java, your computer knows where to find these because scoop setup our paths

## JRE

Java Runtime Environment, includes the bare minimum to execute a java program
- All of the runtime libraries
- The JVM

## JVM

Java Virtual Machine

An OS dependent virtual machine which takes the compiled Java code, and iterprets it into the machine specific code
- Inside of the virtual machine is the memory for our program

## Complete Java compilation process
1. Use the JDK to compile your source code in any .java files into byte code stored in .class files
- This is done through the JDK's built it program `javac`
2. Use the JRE to run the compiled class file of our program
- The JRE comes with the program called `java` which runs a specified class file
3. The JRE calls upon the JVM, the JVM takes the byte code stored in the class file and converts it to machine specific language and runs the code you wrote


# Git

Version Control Systems
- Allow you to keep track of any and all changes to a project/in your code
- Provides a collaboration tool for groups/teams

We have two types of Software Version Control Systems
- Central
	- One copy of the project on one central machine, no one gets master copy
- Distributed
	- Many copies of the master project are distributed among multiple machines
- Git is the most typical choice for distributed version control
- Stores code in folders called Repositories
	- A central repo can be hosted on a service such github
	- Developers pulls an official copy of this code from this repository where they can make changes to it on their machine
	- Any and all developers can commit and push those changes back to the hosted repository

To configure our first repository, lets open the folder we have been working and run `git init`
- This will create a local repository

When we use git init it will create a hidden .git folder which holds all the information about our project, and the history

To start, git knows nothing about your project, because we have not setup anything to be tracked, or comitted, we can see this when we run`git status` 

We need to tell git to track our files, to do this we run `git add` with whatever files we want to track, or `git add .` to add all the changed files
- When we run git add it will literally add these changes to a Staging area, where they are waiting to be commited to the projects history

Now you run `git commit -m "message" and add a new entry to the repository
- You can look at commits as snapshots of where you project was at specific moments

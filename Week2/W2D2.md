# Java 8 Features

Java 8 implemented many new and useful features including:
- Functional Interfaces
- Lambda Expressions
- Stream API
- Reflections API
- Date and Time API
- Optional Classes
- Predicates

# Functional Interfaces and Lambdas

Functional interfaces are interfaces with only one abstract method

- Implicitily be created by lambdas
- Can explicitly create them to be used by lambdas

Lambdas are possibly the biggest addition to Java 8, they introduce important aspects of functional programing, allow for disembodied methods, aka functions

The basic syntax for lambdas `parameters(s) -> expression`

For multiple parameters you will need to wrap them in parenthesis, for multiple lines of logic you will need curly braces

The return keyword is optional

# Default keyword for interfaces

Java 8 assed the ability for developers to add implementations to methods inside of an interface

If you use the keyword `default` in and interface, you can implement a method of said interface

# Introduction to Javalin

We are going to use Javalin to turn our java applications into a webservice

Javalin is a lightweight web framework for Java and Kotlin

It allows us to create a webservice, and allow users to send and receive data from our service without having to configure servlets
- Servlets are the underlying technology used with Java to handle HTTP requests, and send HTTP responses

Java runs on an embedded Jetty Server, so we don't have to fumble around with configuring out own Tomcat servers

You will see a heavy use of lambdas in Javalin

To use Javalin you will need to add the dependencies to our build.gradle
- Javalin
- slf4j
- Jackson Databind

Then to get started with Javalin, you just need to create a new Javalin Object, in the main method with any configurations, then run the .start() method, with a port number

java
```
Javalin app = Javalin.create(config -> {});
app.start(8000);
```

After you have created the Javalin app, you can start setting up your RESTful endpoint

## HTTP Handlers
the handler is a functional interface that should take in a Context Object (ctx) as parameter
- The Context Object is an abstraction of the HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse objects

To setup a handler, you simply use (Javalin app)dot whatever HTTP verb you want to watch for, and give it the logic to handle the request, along with the uri/endpoint to the resource

Examples of setting up handlers:


```java
app.get("/path", <lambdaexpression>);
app.get("/path", (ctx) -> {logic});
app.get("/path", implentation function);
//The routes would look like this:
// /path/subpath
app.routes( () -> {
    path("/path", () ->d {
        get("/subpath", implementation from controller);
        post("/subpath", implentation from controller);
    })
});
```

# PostMan

Postman is a very useful application that allows us to send HTTP Requests to servers, and nicely view the HTTP responses sent back

We will be using to manually test our API endpoints, and you will be using it to show the functionality of your P0

It is highly recommended to get very familiar with this tool and all of its features moving forward, because you will be using it a lot

# JSON (Javascript Object Notation)

JSON is a data exchange format that is easily read by humans and computers

String format that represents objects in key value pairs

Syntax:

```json
{
    "key": "value1",
    "key2": "value2"
}
```
- {} represent an object
- Key: the fields of the object
- Values: the fields values
- [{},{},{}] arrays to send multiple objects

## Why JSON
1. This makes nice and easy for our frontend to convert the objects
2. Our api's are going to be consumed by a client application (HTML/CSS/Javascript)
3. Javascript is virtually the ONLY viable option for a power, popular Client Side Programming

# Serialization via Jackson

The Jackson API is used to convery Java objects into JSON format to send in an HTTP response, and to convert the JSON sent from HTTP requests back into Java objects

Use ObjectMapper.writeValue() method to convert from Java to JSON

Use ObjectMapper.readValue() method to convert from JSON to Java

# Keep Track of which user is using our app

We can do this with HTTP Session API

Http Session API is a way to identify a user and store information about them based on their HTTP requests

Sessions require that you be hosting your website

You can manage these sessions nicely (kinda) with Javalin

1. Can use the context object from the http hander to create a key/value session pair
    - `context.req.getSesstion().setAttribute(key, value);`
2. You can retrieve the session attributes with:
    - `context.req.getSession().sessionAttribute(key)`
    - if it does not exist it will be null
3. You can remove a session attribute/invalidate the session:
    - `context.req.getSession().invalidate()`

One other things to note .getSession method will create a new session if one does not exist

# Exception/Error Mapping

In Javalin you can send responses back based on exceptions that have occured in your code

To do this you simply use the .exception method of the app/server variable that we created

Inside of the .exception method you include the exception that the application is listening for, and how you want to handle with Javalin

Example:

```java
app.exception(NullPointerException.class, (e,ctx) -> {
    //Handle the null pointer here
});
```

We can also handle errors by using Error code, this again is similar to the above exception, except the method is .error()

Inside of the error method you pass the status code, and then write the handler like normal

```java
app.error(404, ctx -> {
    //Handle the error code
})
```

# OWASP Topic - Insecure Deseralization

The newest member of the Top 10

If you take some untrusted user input that you haven't validated, and you allow it to be deserialized from byte stream into an object. An attacker can take advantage of that and insert malicious scripts into your data base or code in order to get sensitive data and harm the server or client. Or maybe an attacker could execute some scripts that result in a Dos attack, or give themselves access to the application as an admin

## How do to avoid insecure deserialization

Validate User input
- This is the most common sense way to avoid this issue, but also the main way, outside of just completely avoiding user input
- Ensure that any user input is coming in with the correct format, and appropriate values
- Anything the user can input must be stricly secured so that an attacker can't insert something like malicous code into what is meant to be a username/password input

Web application firewalls
- so that when an arttack like this is attempted, a firewall can potentially be configured to catch and block them

# Websockets

Websockets provide us with a full-duplex communication channel over a single TCP channel

The idea is that once you connnect, you will no longer have to send requests, you will just automatically receive any message sent across the open channel

The websocket connection stays open, which greatly reduces latency and copmlexity, these are great for realtime chatting apps and other things of that sort

# Introduction to RDBMS

DBMS: Database management System

- These are what we use to store and manage data in our databases
- The ultimate goal of our databases is to persist data

RDBMS: Relational Database Management System
- This is what we will be using during training
- Relational databases are used to store information in tables that have relations with one another
- RDBMS's are structured so that it maintains security, accuracy, integrety, and consistencty of data

## Database:

A collection of structured data, typically grouped into tables
- Each table has rows and columns
    - The row will hold the information about the entry
    - The columns are attributes of the items in the table

# SQL: Structured Query Language

Underlying language used to query relational databases
- Not a programming language
- English like syntax
- There are many different flavors of SQL

## Database Vendors
- Oracle
- Postgresql
- MYSQL
- Microsoft SQL Server
- Microsoft Access and more

We will be using Postgres during this training

# SQL Sublanguages

There are 5 sublanguages in SQL

DDL, DML, DCL, DQL, TCL

## Data Definition Language (DDL):

Used to define the database itself
- Deal with the creation, alteration or deletion of tables, schemas, or databases
- Syntax/Keywords for DDL:
    - CREATE: used to create a table, schema, or database
    - ALTER: used to make changes on a table, schema or database
    - DROP: used completely remove a table
    - TRUNCATE: used to remove the data from a table, but keep the structure intacts

## Schema:

A database schema refers to the formal sctructure of data defined by a relational database:
- the various tables with theirs columns and data types
- the relationships between the tables in the database

Schemas also enforce constraints when defining tabales, so we can visualize them using Entity Relationship Diagrams

## Constraints

Are restrictions that we can put on the columns of our tables in SQL

This is esentially how we are capable of enforcing/creating the schema of the database

Some constraints include:
- Composite Key: a key that uses more than on column
- Not null: the column must have data
- Unique: no two records entered into the table can have the same data in this column
- Primary Key: denotes the column as the primary key
- Foreign Key: denotes that the column references a column of a different table
- Default: create a default value if one is not specified
- Serial: an old way of auto generating a primary key
- Identity: a newer way of auto generating a priary key

Every table needs a Primary Key column
- The primary key is unique and not null implicitly

## SQL Data Types

Each of our columns will store some sort of data, we use datatypes to specify the type of data

Common Postgres datatypes:
- boolean (bool): true or false
- character (char[n]): a fixed character string, of length n
- character varying (var char[n]): varying character string as large as n
- date: calendar date
- integer: whole number
- numberic/decimal(num of total digits, number of digits after 0): a decimal number

More about postgres datatypes:

https://postgrespro.com/docs/postgresql/10/datatype#:~:text=The%20following%20types%20(or%20spellings,without%20time%20zone)%2C%20xml%20.

## Data Control Language (DCL):
Used to manage the security and control over our databases
- Syntax/Keywords
    - GRANT: grant access/permissions
    - REVOKE: revoke access/permissions

# Overview of AOP and Cross Cutting Concerns

AOP stands for Aspect Oriented Programnming, instead of concerning ourselves with objects, we focus on Aspects, which modularize particular concerns which can be presented across multiple classes known as cross cutting concerns

Examples:

- Database access
- Data entities
- Error Handling
- Logging

AOP and cross cutting concerns help reduce code redundancy by transfering the responsibility of these problems to aspects

## AOP Terminology:

Aspect: a representation of a concern which cuts across multiple classes

Weaving: the process of linking aspects with other objects, such as beans to create advised objects
- Spring will do the reaving for us at runtime

Join Points: a specific moment in execution of the program, such as the involcation of a method, where an action takes place

Advice: action taken by an aspect at a specific join point

Pointcut: a definition of which methods our application advice ought to be into or around. This essentially defines our join points

Introduction: delcaration of new interfaces and corresponding implementations in subclasses of any advised object. Introductins use `@DeclareParents` annotation with the defaultImpl attribute to define a concrete class for the bean definition

# AspectJ

@AspectJ refers to a style of declaring aspects through the use of regular java classes with annotations

@AspectJ style was introduced by AspectJ 5, Spring interprets the same annotations as AspectJ 5, using a library supplied by AspectJ, however Spring AOPS's runtime is not dependent on the AspectJ compiler or weaver

# Spring AOP

the Spring module that utilizes AspectJ to easily implement AOP principles in Java

## Cross Cutting Concerns

parts of a program that rely on, or must affect many other parts of the system

## Advice:

Like mentioned above, advice is a specific action taken, defined as a method, at a particular point during execution of a program

There are 5 types of advice:
- Before: advice that will execute before a join point, but does not have the capability to halt the normal execution of the proceeding join point (unless an execption gets thrown)
- After Returning: advice that will execute after a join point completes without throwing an exception
- After Throwing: advice that will execute after a join points complete with throwing an exception
- After: advice that will execute regardless of the join points outcome
- Around: advice that will execute before and after the join point. It is the most general, but also the most powerful. It can perform custom behavior before and after a join point, and be responsible for choosing whether or not to procedd to the join point

In general, it is recommended to use the least powerful type of advice for any particular task.

# Pointcuts and JointPoints

Point cuts are going to determine the join points, because they define which methods in our application ought to be injected before, after or around

Join points are those specific points of execution that we want our program to inject advice

Point cuts are comprised of a name, and any parameters, and keep in mind that these determine EXACTLY which method(s) execution we are interested in

To create a point cut we use `@Pointcut` annotation with regular method signatures, these include:

- execution
- within
- this
- target
- args
- @target
- @args
- @within
- @annotation

Execution is the most widely used, and you use patterns with wildcards to specify the join points

```java
execution(?modifiers-pattern ret-type-pattern ?declaring-type-pattern name-pattern(param-pattern) ?throws-pattern)
```

# AWS RDS (Relational Database Service)

a service that makes it easier to setup, operate, and scale a relational database in the AWS Cloud

- cost efficient, resizable capacity for indrustry standard relational databases
- manages database adminstration tasks for

## Adding a database as a service

1. Login, or create an AWS account

-   Login here: https://aws.amazon.com/
-   Create an account here: https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup?nc2=h_ct&src=header_signup&redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Faws.amazon.com%2Fregistration-confirmation#/start

2. Navigate to the RDS Dashboard by searching RDS and clicking the first result
3. Click Create database
4. We want to make the following selections:

-   Standard Create
-   PostgreSQL 12.5-R1
-   Free Tier
-   Name the db whatever you like
-   Master username leave as postgres
-   You whatever password you like, make sure you don't forget it
-   Make sure you are using a t2.micro for your instance class
-   Choose yes on public access
-   We will keep the default VPC and edit it later
-   Click create database

5. Now we wait for it to be created
6. After it is created, select the database and click on the default VPC

-   We still need to setup rules for inbound and outbound traffic

7. Choose Actions then edit inbound rules
8. Set the source from Custom to anywhere, ideally we would set this IP address of members with priveleges to access this netword, but we will set it to anywhere for the the sake of our training
9. Do the same for outbound rules
10. Lets also turn off automatic backups so no one will get charged, choose modify in the top right on the RDS dashboard
11. Go to additional configuration, and put the Backup retention period to 0 days
12. Click continue, then modify db instance

# Object Relational Mapping (ORM):

ORM's convert the data between relational databases and objects in object oriented programming languages

- Essentially turns our Java objects, into an entry in a database table

Most object-oriented applications store data in relational databases which use tables, while the application classes create objects, in order to get that data into a db we must convert

Benefits of ORM's:
- ORM's mao an object to the table for you
- We hide the details of SQL queries from OO logic, this propagates the idea of data abstraction
- It provides methods for automatic versioning and time stamping
- It provides caching for better performance
- Best suited for large projects
- Injected transaction management
- Configurable logging
- Faster development of application

There are lots of ORM's available, including hibernate, JPA, Active JOA, iBATIS, and more

## Hibernate and JPA

JPA is the Java Persistence API, and it is the standard API for access, persisting, and managing data between Java objects and Relational Database tables

You can find it in the javax.persistence package

Hibernate is an ORM tool for Java programming
- It is a flexible and powerful ORM solution to map Java classes to database tables
- It is an implementation of JPA, so it follows the standards provided by JPA
- It is defined under org.hibernate
- It uses the Hibernate Query Langauge (OOP query language)
- Hibernate sessions interface is an extension to JPA's EntityManager

## Hibernate Annotations

Hibernate adds functionality to the JPA annotations, so those are what we will be using for Hibernate

@Entity denotes the java object is going to be stored in the database

@Table allows you to set information about the table that will be created based on the entity

@Column marks a field in your java class as a column in a database table

@Id marks the field as the primary id of your database table

@ManyToMany is used to create a junction table between two classes in java

@ManyToOne is used to create a many to one relationship between two classes in java

@OneToMany is used to create a one to many relationship between two classes in java

## Hibernate Mapping Classes

You first must setup Hibernate configuration this is stored in the hibernate.cfg.xml, you set the following properties

- hibernate.dialect
- hibernate.connection.driver_class
- hibernate.connection.url
- hibernate.connection.username
- hibernate.connection.password
- hibernate.pool.size
- user_sql_comments (this will show you the sql version of what you wrote in java)
- hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto (this will determine whether or not you are recreating the database every time you run your code)

After setting up the configuration, you would create classes for your models like normal, and annotate them for hibernate to convert them to database tables

Use hibernate sessions to make connections to your database and make queries

## HQL (Hibernate Query Language)

An object oriented query language that allows you to query against the objects in your java code rather than the tables in your database

Hibernate automatically translates these HQL queries into native SQL depending on the dialect that you chose
- This helps decouple the code from our database, and we can easily switches databases easily because all we have to do is change the dialect

HQL is case sensitive of properties like table and colunm names, but not for keywords like SELECT, FROM, etc.

Advantages of HQL:
- Support for OOP concepts like Polymorphism, Inheritance, and abstraction
- Database independent and easy to learn

# Spring ORM

Springs Object Relational Mapping Framework/Module

Spring ORM supports Hibernate, Java Data Objects (JDO), Java Persistence API and more

We use Spring ORM to handle Hibernate for us

You configure Spring ORM in the same beans.xml file we have been using previously

Benefits of Spring ORM:
- Easier testing
- Data Access Exception Wrapping
- Resource Management
- Integrated Transaction Management

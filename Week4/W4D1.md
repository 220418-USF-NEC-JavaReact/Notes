# Node.JS

Node JS is an open-source, cross platform, runtime environment for Javascript built on the chrome v8 engine

- Is not a Programming Language
- It is a run-time environment that allows you to run javascript outside of the browser

## Node Package Manager (npm):

Is a package manager for the javascript language. It is the default manager for the node evironment

npm consists of three components:
- the website: discovers packages, sets up profiles, and manages access to packages
- CLI runs from the terminal and allows us to interact with npm
- the registry is a public database of javascript packages

We use Node and npm tools to create/build our React applications

## package.json

When you create a Javascript project with node `npm init`, it automatically creates a package.json file, in the root directory of the project

The package.json is going to hold information about the about:
- description
- version
- license information
- author
- entry point
- depdencies
- scripts

There are two types of depdencies in the package.json
- dependencies: are essential for running the application
- devDependencies: are dependencies that are only needed during development, will not be include in the final version

# ES6 exports and imports (Modules)

Modules are self-contained units of functionality that can be shared and reused across projects

The `export` keyword is used to create a module, and export live bindings to objects, objects, or even primitive values so they can be used elsewhere

In ES6 and later, you can use the `import` keyword to import the modules you previously exported into other scripts

We will be using this feature alot with React later this week

# Typescript Intro

Typescript is an open source, object oriented, typed, superset of Javascript created by microsoft
- Object oriented: adds more oop functionality to JS
- SuperSet means that it has all the functionality of JS, but extra added on top
- type:
    - Added static type checking/static typing
- It also originally added this features
    - Classes
    - Interfaces
    - Inheritance
    - Modules
    - Types
- At this point Javascript has implemented most of typescripts functionality
    - The biggest reasons people are using typescript still is state type checking, custom types, interfaces, and added inellisense for JS
- It is portable across browsers and devices

Typescript is not directly readible by the browser, you must transpile it into javascript before running it in the browser or in node

To compile you run `tsc filename` and it will create a js file with the corresponding file name
- You can change which ES version it is transpiled to in the tsconfig.json file

To install typescript you use the npm command `npm i -g typescript`

## Datatypes

Like javascript you still declare variables with var, let, and const, however know you must declare a type

- ex. `let varname : [type] = value`

There are 11 datatypes in Typescript

- Boolean: true or false
- Number: integer or decimal number
- String: text inclosed by single or double quotes
- Undefined: same as JS
- Null: same as JS
- Any: act as a normal JS variable
- Void: used for functions that do not return anything
- Arrays: dynamically sized like JS, however they only store a single datatype
- Tuples: an array with a fixed number of objects
- Enum: declare a set of named constants
- Never: represents a type of value that never occurs

# Classes and Access Modifiers

Classes in Typescript are slightly different than in JS, mainly because they have three access modifers available for your use

Like javascript the `class` keyword is used to declare a class, and the `new` keyword is used to create new instance of the class

You can implement inheritance with typescript classes using the `extends` keyword similar to java and javascript

Our access modifiers in TS:
- public: the default access modifier, can be access anywhere
- private: can only be accessed inside of the class
- protected: can only be accessed inside of the class or child classes

We can also make properties read only with the `readonly` modifier

Mutators: TS has mutators (getters and setters) similar to javascript, you use the keywords `get` and `set` to create them, then you can use these methods as properties rather than methods

Instead of doing this `someObject.getValue()` you would call `someObject.getValue`

Or `someObject.setValue(value)` you would call `someObject.setValue = value`

# Interfaces

Allows us to create contracts that other classes/objects can implement

You define an interface with the `interface` keyword, which includes the properties you want the class/object to have

You can include optional properties with `?`

The typescript compiler does not convert the interface into code, it just uses for type checking purposes

# Custom Types

In Typescript there is also the ability to create custom types, these act similarly to interfaces, where programmers must include all the properties to compile successfully,

Custom types and interfaces are almost interchangable, however yuo many want to use types over interfaces when you are simply storing other primitive types, arent planning to inherit, or are planning to use a union operator.

Union operator, allows us to tell typescript that a function/method may return different types

We will be exploring use of interfaces and customs in React

# Decorators

I a special kind of declaration attached to a class, method, accessor, property, or parameter that looks and act like annotations from Java

In typescript we have to enable experimental support for decorators to be able to use these

# OWASP Topic - Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities

Web applications have multiple key components, they may have a server, a postgres database, a Java backend, and a React frontend, the frontend will probably will probably talk to the backend with HTTP requests

Because of this, some or many of these components, and libraries used for these components will have security vulnerabilities that are well know to attackers

As a developer there will become a time where you are forced to suse some components that have some known vulnerabilities, but you can still counter these.

## Ways to counter act these known vulnerabilities

Constantly inventory your clients and servers. Always take stock of your components and vulnerablities. That way you can always be aware of what risks you are taking with your components, and take steps to mitigate these risks

Only download components from trusted sources/official sources. If you are going to download a software you want to make sure you get it straight from the trusted source

Plan for monitoring and patches. Have a plan in place to monitor all your components and patch them as new patches come out that handle problems that surface in each component

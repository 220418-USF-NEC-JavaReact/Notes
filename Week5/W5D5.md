# OWASP Topic - Sensitive Data Exposure

When a web application is storing sensitive data (password, social security, etc) and somehow allows that data to get exposed

## How to protect against Sensitive Data Exposure

Data should be classified, so not all data you work with is necessarily sensitive. Make sure you treat the different data appropriately

You should also apply controls to the data. If the data in question is especially sensitive, you will want to work extra hard to protect it. If its less sensitive, don't put as much time and or effort into protecting it

Encrypt data at rest. Data at rest is any data stored physically in any digital form

A web application should have strong cyphers, if you want look into TLS encryption

The most obviously, don't store sensitive data if you dont have to. If it is possible to use the data then throw after you are done, this is typcially the best case

## OWASP Topic - Broken Access Control

Access control is about giving users access to the different resources in your application, and restricting access to certain resources that they should not have access to

Imagine functionality meant only for admins, and some other functionality for normal users

If a general user were to gain access to admin features this would be an instance of broken access control

## How can we prevent this

Using Dynamic Application Security Testing Tools, and State Application Security Testing Tools to make sure access control is present. But, these tools cannot tell you how good the protection is, just that is some protection. To test how "good" you typically have to do some manual testing

Practice writing trusted server-side code which implements various checks to ensure that users are only able to access what they should

Denyby default, have some features the public can see, and strictly deny everything else by default. This will result in multiple layers of features with increasingly rodust restrictions as you go deeper

- Building restrictions around the entire application like this is more efficient than building access control around each group of functionality

# OWASP Topic - Security Misconfiguration

When you develop a web application, you need to be aware of the different vulnerabilies that come with each of the tools you use

- Your SQL server probably has known vulnerabilies
- Your Log4j has known vulnerabilities
- Your frontend frameworks probablity have some vulnerabilities

## Some things that could happen in terms of security misconfiguration

Anything that unneccessarily enabled is a potential door for hackers to get in

Some default error pages from servers can give away information about your server, database, and their versions. This gives attackers a full list of ways they can try to attack you

## How to prevent these attacks/supplement security

You MUST make sure to get any patches and updates for any of the tools you are using, you can make suire to have the latest security features

When a server responds to a client, you should be sure to incluide one of many security headers that are available to our server

Repearable Hardening Processs: a process that can repeatedly run and test the durablity of your application against attacks

All servers you are running need to have the same configuration from a security standpoint

Have a minimal platform footprint. If you dont need the feature that comes with your tools, turn them off

Going forward with React and Spring Boot I would suggest using LocalStorage over Sessions

Ethans Solution to the Coding Challenge:

```
public static int message(String S)
  {

    //this is default OUTPUT. You can change it.
    int result = 0;

    //write your Logic here:
    for(int i=0; i<S.length(); i++){
      if(Character.isAlphabetic(S.charAt(i))){
        if(Character.isUpperCase(S.charAt(i))){
          result+=2;
        }
        else{
          result+=1;
        }
      }
    }

      return result;
  }
```

# Sonar Cloud Set and Reports

Sonar cloud is a cloud based review solution which can be configured to review code within a cloud repository, such as Github

# SonarQube Quality Model

The SonarQube Quality model has four different types of rules:
- Reliablity (bug)
- Maintainability (code smells)
- Security
    - Vulnerabality
    - Hotspot

# Sonar Security Injection/Configuration Rules

Security-injection rules: there is a vulnerability here when the inputs handled by your application are controlled by a user (potentially be a hacker) and not validated or sanitized, when this occurs, the flow from sources (user-controlled inputs) to sinks (sensitive functions) will be presented. To do this, SonarQube uses well-known tatint analysis technology on source code which allows the dection of:
- SQL Injection
- Cross Site Scripting
- Code Injection

TLDR sonarqube can tell you if your code is suspect to the above attacks

Security-Configuration rules: there is a security issue because the wrong parameter (eg: invalid cryptographic algorithm, or TLS version) when calling a sensitive functions have been set or when a check (eg. check_permissions() kind of function) was not done, or not in the correct order, this problem is likely to apear when the program is executed (not injected/complex attack are requored unlike in the previous category)

- Sensitive Cookie without HttpOnly flag
- Improper validation of certificate with host mismatch
- User of broken or risky cryptographic algorithm

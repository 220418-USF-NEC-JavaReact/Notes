# Data Lifecycle Overview

The data in our systems goes through a set of steps we call the data lifecycle

The exact amount of steps, and exactly what those steps are differ depending on who you ask, but there is still a basic overview

1. Data Collection: We are going to get the data from somewhere

2. Data Processing: We are going to process the data and get it into a form where we can store it

3. Data Storage: We want to store the data for later use and analysis

4. Analysis / Interpretation: Finally, we can use the data that has been collection and stored to be analyized and use for our application/business

# OLTP

Online Transaction Processing

Data processing that constists of executing a number of transactions concurrently

- Online Banking
- Online shopping

Traditionall these transactions are stored for enterprises to later look through for record keeping and data analysis

Online transaction processing typically involves inserting, updating, and or deleting small amounts of data in a data store to collect, manage, and secure the transactions in question

## OLTP System Features

Real-time execution of large numbers of database transactions by a large number of people

Lightning-fast response times

Modify small amounts of data frequently and usually involves a balance of reads and writes

Use indexed data to improve response time

Require frequent or concurrent database backups

Require realitively little storage

Usually run simple queries involving just one or a few records

## Requirements for OLTP Systems

The common architecture of an OLTP system that uses transactional data is a three tier architecture that typically consists of a presenation tier, a business logic tier, and a data store tier.

- The presentation tier is the front end, where the transaction orginates via a human interaction or it is system generated

- The logic tier consists of rules that verify the transaction and ensures all the data required to complete the transaction is present and available

- The data store tier stores the transaction and all the data related to it

The system must adhere to the ACID properties

Must be able to handle thousands of users accessing data concurently

Must be scalable, at some points the number of active users will spike, others it will be lower

Must be available 24/7

Must allow for high throughput and short response times

Must reliable

Must be secure

And must be recoverable

The databse that best fits this type of system is a relational database management system

# Data sources - Deep Dive

Data: anything that we can quantify (not always numberic)
- figures, numbers, text, pictures, values, dates, etc
- if you can store it in a database it is data
    - files
    - images
    - videos

## Where do we get this data?

Short answer: anywhere

When it comes to businesses: data can come from their personal sales numbers, research, or projections

Data can be scraped off the web using a web crawler

Date can come from preexisting databases that one may have access to

Data can come from files, such json, excel, or csv files

All of these sources can give valuable data that be extracted and stored for our own personal benefit

# Database Vendors

There are many different providers/vendors of RDBMS systems including:
- Oracle
- Postgres
- MySQL
- Microsoft SQLServer
- Microsoft Access

But there is also such thing as NoSQL database vendors:

- MongoDB
- Cassandra
- ElasticSearch
- Amazon DynamoDB
- HBase

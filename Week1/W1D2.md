## Git Branching Basics

Every project has at least one branch known as the main branch, this is where the working code is stored. The HEAD points at the most recent commit you have made, as you make commits this pointer/head points to the next commit, and so and so forth.

Our main branch can be see as a timeline of our entire project

Branching is a strategy to create a copy of a branch, typically a copy of the main branch, and make changes to that code independent of the main branch

Branches are typically used to create new features separate from the main project code/working code to protect it from bugs/being broken. Once the feature you are working is complete, we can combine this new code with the original code in the main branch, otherwise known as merging

There are a couple ways you can create a new branch with git

1. Using the two step: `git branch <name>` `git checkout <branchname>`
2. Using `git checkout -b <name>`

When the new branch is created, it will contain the current version of whatever branch you started on

You can then create, make changes and follow the same git flow from yesterday

When you are ready to combine branches from the feature to your main, use `git merge branchname` keep in mind you want to run this command from the branch you want to merge INTO

Lets add some notes here on the practice branch

# Methods

A method is a named block of code declared inside of a class
- A function attached to an object

A method must:
- Be declared inside of a class
- Have a return type, if you want the method to return nothing you can use the `void` return type
- It must have a name, followed parenthesis
    - Optionally you can pass in parameters into these parenthesis
- The start and end of the code block are denoted by curly braces

### We use the `return` keyword to tell our method to return a value

java
```
returnType name(parameters){
    logic goes here
}
```

Parameters are values passed into a method
- If you declare a method to take parameters you MUST pass the method those paremeters, otherwise it will result in a compilation error
- We can pass as many parameters to a method as we like, they just have to separated by a commas

Var args is a notation in java to pass an unset amount of parametes of a single datatype
- Uses the `...` notation
- There can only be one varargs in a method, and it MUST be the last parameter
- Varargs gets converted to an array behind the scenes (more on arrays later)
- `method(int ... values){}`

## The `main` method

A special method in Java which is used to run the program
- Its called main because that what the Java developers called it
- It will always have the same syntax, so remember it!
    - `public static void main(String args[]){}`

## Constructors

To create a new object we must use the `new` keyword with a constructor

Are special methods in Java which are used to initialized instances of objects
- They don't have a return type
- Share the name of the class being created
- We can give them specific values to set inside of our object

Ever class in Java implicitly gets given a constructor at run time, this is what we consider the default contructor
- The default constructor will set all of your class memberss to their default state

There are also two other types of constructors
- The no argument constructor
- Parameterized Constructor

No argument constructor is simply a constructor a programmer physically writes, but takes no arguments
- It is NOT the same as the default

Parameterized is a constructor the programmer physically writes, but takes in arguments

- The `this` keyword is often used inside of paremeterized constructors to set variables that belong to the specific object we are creating

If you explicitly created ANY constructor inside of your class, the default constructor will no longer be generated at runtime

You can have one constructor in a class, call another constructor in the same class by using the `this()`, this is called constructor chaining.

# Arrays

An object which stores elements of the same data type
- The elements are stored via index, in an array each index is located next to one another in memory
- Array indexes start at 0, you access specific elemnts in the array by these indexes
- The array must be given a size when instantiated, and you cannot resize
- The `length` property gives programmers access to the size of the array

There are multiple ways to declare an array
- `datatype arr[]`
- `datatype[] arr`

There are multiple ways to instantiate an array
- `datatype arr[] = new datatype[size]`
- `int arr[] = {1,2,3,4,5}`;

Arrays are considered objects, meaning we can store arrays inside of arrays, making multideminsional arrays

- These can be used to model matrixes, and be used to solve dynmic programming problem

To create a multiple dimensional array, we just add more square brackets

- `datatype[][] arr`

The first set of indexes in our multi-dimensional array are storing arrays
- Theses are similar to rows and columns
- `dataType[row][col] arr`

# Adding logic to our Programs

Our programs can only store data at the moment, we have no way of doing anything real useful
- We use Operators and Control Flow Statements to add this logic

## Java Operators

Operators apply some logic tot he values stored in our variables

Java has many types of operators, here are some the important ones:

- Arithmetic: +, -, \*, /, %
- Relational: <, > , <=, >=
- Equality: ==, !=
- Bitwise: &, |, ^
- Logical Operators: &&, ||
    - Logical operators can short circuit
        - If the result of the operation can be determined by looking at the first half of the expressions, it will return without looking at the second half
- Ternary: `expression ? true : false`
- Assignment: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=
- Postfix: x++, x--
    - Postfix operations evaluate the value in the variable, then after whatever evaluation is done, it will increment/decrement the value
- Prefix: ++x, --x:
    - Prefix operations increment/decerment the value, then do whatever evaluation is needed

## Java Control Flow Statements
Control flow statements can break up the normal flow of our application

Two main types of control flow statements in java
- Loops
- Branching

Loops are used to perform some logic repeatedly until a certain condition is met

### Loops types in Java:

For loops will loop a set number of times
- `for(looping variable; looping condition; loop increment;){}`
- Set a variable at a starting point, then you loop until you have reaced the looping condition
- `for(int i=0; i<4; i++){}`

While loop will loop while a condition is true
- `while(condition){}`
- while loops can be more dynamic because instead of looping a set number of times, you loop until you decide the condition should be false
- Be careful because you can cause an infinite loop

Do-While loop, are similar to while loops, except they will run at least once, even if the looping condition is false
- ```java
    do{
        logic
    } while(condition)
  ```

### The `continue` keyword can be used with loops to break out of the current iteration, and start again at the top of the loop
You can only use the continue keyword inside of a loop

Branching statements allow us to check for equality and decide to go to a different branch of code depending on the result

### Branching/Conditional Statements in Java

If statements are the most basic branching statement
- `if(condition){logic}`
- if the condition is true, we will run the code the following block
- if the condition is false, we will skip over the block, and continue down our code

Else statements accompany the if statement, these are blocks of code to be run if the if statment is false

- ```java
  if(condition){
      if logic
  } else {
      else logic
  }
  ```

If/else if, is used if you have multiple conditions you want to check for

- ```java
  if(condition){

  }
  else if(another condition){

  }
  else {

  }
  ```

Switch statements are similar to if/else if statements. You give the switch block a value to read, then define cases to match on the given variable
- The input to the switch block is allowed to be: String, char, byte, short, int, Enum
- You must use a break statement or a return statement in each case, otherwise your code could run through and run multiple cases
- You can/should also include a `default` case incase the input does not match any given case
- ```java
  switch(month){
      case "January":
        return 1;
      case ...
      .
      .
      .
  }

### The `break` keyword can be used in branching and looping operations, to break out of the current block of code

# String API

In Java Strings are an object derived from the String class

Strings store a sequence of characters as their state

- You cannot change/modify the content of a string after it is set, this means that is is immutable
- If you want to change the value of a String, you must completely override the current value stored

Like many other java classes, the String class has several useful methods attached to it:
- charAt(int index)
- concat(String str)
- indexOf(char ch)
- length()
- subString(int start, int end)
- and more

Something to keep in mind with the String methods, is that since Strings are immutable, all of the string methods return a new string
- They will NOT modify the string you call the method on
- `someString = "hello"`
- `someString = someString.concat("Some more string")`
- `someString = someString + "Some more String"`

Strings are objects, so they get stored in memory like reference objects, however String are special

Since we use Strings so often, they get their own special place in memory called the String Pool

- String pool is going to be in the Heap

There are no duplicates allowed in the String pool
- This save on memory

Any duplication String, will point to the same reference in the String pool

If for some reason you want two Strings to store the same sequence but be different objects, you can use the String constructor instead of String literals

String literal is where you use the quotation marks
- Anystring created by a string literal will be stored in the string if not already created
- Anything String created by the constructor not in the String pool will also be added

## StringBuilder and StringBuffer

StringBuilder is a class which allows us to create mutable strings

- Store a sequence of characters just like Strings
- But allows us to manipulate the sequence of characters directly
    - append()
    - insert()
    - delete()
    - and more

Be careful about StringBuilder when threads are involved because StringBuilder is not thread safe

StringBuffer is essentially the same thing as StringBuilder, except you can use it with threads because it is thread safe

# Scanner Class

So far we have manually input all data for our applicatio

In Java we have the scanner class in java.utils, which can read user input from the console/terminal

Most typically the scanner will be used with System.in as its source, this is explicitly how we user input

The Scanner class has methods to get entire lines of text, numbers, letters, and more from the console

# Object Oriented Programming

Object Oriented Programming is a paradigm which relies on creating classes and objects based on real world object and behaviors

When we talk about Object Oriented Programming we have 4 main principles or pillars associated with it, please remember these

Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inhertiance, Encapasulation

Abstraction is hiding detail of implemetation, while still providing the user access to the functionality

Polymorphism is the ability for an object to take on many forms

Inheritance is the ability for an object to take on the states and behaviors from a parent object

Encapsulation is hiding data, while making it available through mutators

An accronym is APIE

## Encapsulation

The first and most straight forward pillar is Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the idea in programming to hide the states of your objects, but make them available through mutator methods

We can implement Encapsulation using access modifiers and mutator methods
- The mutators used to get a value from an encapsulated class is called a getter, typically denoted with the method name `getStateVal()`
- The mutators used to set a value in an encapsulated class is called a setter, typically denoted with the method name `setStateVal()`

## Java Modifiers

Modifiers in Java are keywords that modify the functionality of our java classes, methods, and class members
- Two types of modifiers, access and non-access

Access Modifiers are keywords that define the ability of other classes to access the given property/entity

We have four available access modifiers
- public: available everywhere
- protected: available within the same package and subclasses
- default: available within the same package
- private: only available within the same class

Non-access modifiers modify the functionality of our java code but not the access

- There are technically 7 non-access modifiers, but we will typically only see/use 4

`static` denotes a class member has class/static scope
- if a variable or method is denoted as static, that means it belongs to the class
- The method can only be accessed by other static class members
- The variable will be the same across all objects of that class
- We can also access static variables and methods directly through the class
    - `MyClass.staticVariable` or `MyClass.staticMethod()`

`final` keyword makes whatever it is applied to unchangeble
- when applied to a variable in a class, you cannot reassign the variable
- when applied to a class, you cannot extend the class
- when applied to a method, you cannot override the method

`abstract` keyword means two things depending on where it is applied
- when applied to a class, the class can no longer be instantiated dirtectly, you must inherit the class
- when applied to a method, the method cannot have a body, it must be given this implemenation in an extended class (childclass)
    - You are only allowed to have abstract methods inside of an abstract class

`transient` marks a variable of a class not to be serialized
- If you were to write an object to a file, the field marked as transient would be ignored when writing to said file

## Variable Scopes

In java programming language we have 4 different variable scopes

Each scope defines where the variable is accessible, and how long it is available in the program

There are four scopes:

Instance Scope, belongs to the object:
- Each individual object instantiated from a class, will have its own value for that specific variable

Static Scope, this sometimes known as class scope, the variable is going to belong to the class itself
- The variable will store the same value across all objects of that class
- If you change the value in one insance, the value will change across all instances of that class

Method Scope, these variables are created inside of a method block
- Once the method is done executing, the variables are no longer availabled
- You cannot access the variable outside of the method block

Block Scope, these variables are created inside more specific code blocks
- Typically loops or if statements
- Once again, after the loop, or other block of code is finished running, the variable no longer exists
- You can't access the variable outside of that block

## POJO vs Bean

A POJO is a Plain Old Java Object

A Java bean is a special POJO with the following properties
- All Java Beans are POJO's, but not all POJO's are java beans
- They must serializable, ie they can be written to a file
- All fields should be private
- Fields should have getters and setters
- There should at least be a no-args constructor
- Fields are accessed only by constructors or getters and setters

A Java bean is a perfectly encapsulation java object which can be written to a file

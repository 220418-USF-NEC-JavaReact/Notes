# Bubbling and Capturing in Javascript

Javascript has something called event propagation, which essentially is how the event flows through the elements on the page

There are two ways in which an event can propagate, the first is called bubbling and the second is called capturing

## Event Bubbling

Bubbling is the default propagation strategy for event listeners
- Follow a buttom up approach
- The event starts at the target element and "bubbles" its way up to the html tag

Bubbling works for all handlers, reguardless of how they were registered

## Event Capturing

Event capturing is the opposite of bubbling, you start at the html tag, and work your way down to the taget tag
- Following a top to bottom

Capturing only works with event listeners that are registered with the .addEventListener with the added third argument set to true

# Operators and Control Flow

Javascript operators perform some operations on a single or multiple operands and produce a result

There are five types of operators in Javascript
- Arithmetic -, +, `*`, /, %, ++, --
- Comparison: ==, ===, !=, >, <. >=, <=
- Logical: &&, ||, !
- Assignment: =, +=, -=, `*=`, /=, %=
- Ternary: condition ? true : false

Control Flow:

- if/else
- for
- for in
    - Enhanced for loop which loops through the properties of an object
- for of
    - Enhanced for loop which loops through the elements of an array
- while
- do while

# Type Coercion

the process of converting a value from one datatype to another datatype

There are two types of type coercion, explicit and implicit

- Explicit occurs when we specify it to happen
    - `var num = new Number("3")`
- Implicit occurs automatically by Javascript, it happen some times when javascript is attempting to carry out some instruction
    - `var div = "3"/4`

## Differcent between == and ===

They are used to compare object in Javascript
- == compares two values and does not take into account their types
- == essentially performs type coercion to see if the values being compared are the same
- === compare the two values and will check strictly against their types and their values
- === will only return true if the value AND the types are the same

### TLDR: === does strict comparison, type and value must equals, == only compares the value

## Truthy and Falsy in Javascript

In Javascript any expression or value that results in a boolean false is considered falsy, these include:

- boolean false
- empty string ''
- Undefined
- null
- Nan
- 0

Everything else is truthy

# Variable Scopes

The scope of a variable defines the lifetime and visibility of a variable in Javascript
- The variable cannot be access outside of its scope

Two major types of scope: Global and Local

## Global Scope

accessible everywhere in the application/script it has the lifetime of that application

## Local Scope

accessible only in their location

Local scope is broken into function and block

## Function Scope:

variables declared inside of a function, they are only accesible inside of said function, and no longer exist after the function is complete

## Block Scope:

Introduced in ES6, along with the variable keywords `let` and `const`, and these can only be access from inside their block of code, and the lifespan is the life of that block of code.

However, before ES6, there was no "block" scope because of hoisting

# Hoisting:

variable and function declarations are hoisted/moved to the top their scope before code execution

- Only the declarations are hoisted, not the assignments
    - `var d;` this gets hoisted
    - `d = 100` this does not get hoisted
- Any variables inside of block with the `var` keyword, will be hoisted into function scope

# let and const keywords

let and const were introduced in ES6 as means of preventing hoisting from block scope
- It appears from our experimentation, that these are preventing all hoisting

The let keyword allows you to declared a variable in block scope without it being hoisted
- Act just as a var would

The const keyword allows you to declare a variable in block scope, however it acts as a constant, so once assigned, you cannot reassign

It is now considered best practice to use let and const instead of var everywhere in your program

## Function Expressions:

known as anonymous functions, have no identifier/name, and are stored in a variable.

This is once again possible in Javascript, because functions are objects

- example: `let hello = function(){console.log('hello')}`

## Arrow functions

- a new simplified way to write function expressions
- looks like lambdas: `let hello = () => console.log('hello')`
- `let name = (params) => {logic}`
- You call these just like any other function `hello()` => print out hello

## Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE), these are anonymous functions that get called as soon as they are created

To do this, we wrap the function in a set of parenthesis, with a second set to call the function

```javascript
(let func = (params) => {
    some logic in here
    return l;
})();
```

## Template Literals

Template literals are an easy way to create multi-line strings and perform string interpolation
- These are string enclosed in backticks `
- It allows for embedded expressions, placeholders indicated by a dollar sign and curly braces
- ```javascript
  let s = 10;
  console.log(`We have ${s} assignments due this semester`);
  ```
- This will output: "We have 10 assignments due this semester"

## `this` keyword

The `this` keyword has several meanings depending on where its used
- `this` alone refers to the global window object
- `this` in event handers refers to the HTML element that receives the event
- `this` in object method binding refers to the object

# OOP Javascript

Object Oriented Programming Principles

- Abstraction
- Polymorphism
- Inheritance
- Encapsulation

Javascript has what is known as prototypical inheritance:
- All javascript objects have "prototype", This is implemented through `__proto__` property
- This property can be used to define inheritance
- An objects `__proto__` property can be set to reference another object, creating inheritance
- The root proto of all JS objects is Object.prototype, this is the default value of `__proto__`

Javascript uses closures for encapsulation

## Closures

an older way of achieving encapsulation in Javascript. It is a nested function that can access a variable, and arguments of an outer function, but not change them directly

Polymorphism occurs during type coehercion

Javascript uses classes for abstraction and inheritance and encapsulation
- Classes were introduced in ES6 as ways to create object templates, which allows us to create multiple objects with similar atttributes
- It also allows us to take advantage of inhertiance through the use of the extends keyword
- Javascript has even implemented the static keyword, and public and private members
- Classes also have special methods called constructors, that you can tell it how you want the new objects to be created

# Intro to Asynchronous Javascript

program does not need to wait for a specific task that takes a long time to complete

You can simply start a function that takes a while, then move on to a different function while the first one finishes
- You send an api request and forget about it
- When you receive the data back from the request, you can handle it
- Your program does not need to wait for that response to continue working

This is useful for API calls and other process that could hold up or block the execution of the main thread

## How Async Javascript works

Javascript also implements a stack like Java where the function calls are stored
- It uses a single thread to add, and call functions on the stack one at a time, until the stack is empty
- This is how our basic synchronous javascript script works

Javascript also has a queue built into it, along with this queue, the browser/runtime environment also has "web workers"/apis, that allow us to offload lengthy functions to them

After the webapi is done running the function, it puts a callback into that queue we mentioned above, and when javascript has emptied the callstack, it will look in this queue for any returned responses from the webapi

Simple example"

```javascript
const foo = () => console.log("First");
const bar = () => setTimeout(() => console.log("Second"), 500);
const baz = () => console.log("Third");

bar();
foo();
baz();
```

## The basic steps of the event loop

1. Asynchronous code gets added to the call stack
2. JS decides to hand it off to the web api where it processes
3. Other functions can be added and executing on the call stack while the web api does its work
4. Once the web api has a response, it gets added to the queue
5. The event loop checks the queue when the call stack is empty to see if there is something to add back to the stack
6. Our response/callback is added to the call stack and processed as normal

# Timing Events

are functions that attached to the global window object, and allow programmers to automate or run tasks after wating a specific amount of time

These get handled by the event loop and web api

## setTimeout()

`window.setTimeout(function, milliseconds)` will execute the callback function after waiting a specific amount of time in milliseconds

Use the `window.clearTimeout(timeout var)` to stop the timeout before the execution of the function

## setInterval()

`window.setInterval(function, milliseconds)` will execute the function given once every so many milliseconds

Use `window.clearInterval(intervalVar)` to stop the interval similar to how you stop timeout

## Callback Functions

a function that gets passed into another function, and executes once the orginal function is finished
- This is helpful with async code
- All functions are objects, so they can be passed in as parameters
- A callback can also be created inside of another function with the callback keyword

# OWASP Topic - Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

Is essentially client side code injection. Where an attacker tries to steal users information by injecting malicious scripts into a webpages html that executes whenever someone loads the page

There are a few ways this attack can occur:

A website such as a social media site allows users to comment on posts, but they dont sanitize the user input, instead, they take it, and embed directly into the content on the html

Imagine some attacker comments on malicous code that gets cokkies for that site and posts it as a comment to a very popular post

Every time someone opens up that posts, and loads the attackers comment, that attacker is getting that users informat from the cookies

## How do we prevent these attacks

It is generally not a good idea to directly embed content that user inputted into your site

The most typical way to prevent XSS attacks is to santize your data, or strip off any script or other unwanted tag
- You'd want to take the data to the backend, strip it of the bad stuff, then embed it on your page

You can alos use a Security Encoding Library for you backend language of choice to parse through input and encode before injecting it into your html directly

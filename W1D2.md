## Git Branching Basics

Every project has at least one branch known as the main branch, this is where the working code is stored. The HEAD points at the most recent commit you have made, as you make commits this pointer/head points to the next commit, and so and so forth.

Our main branch can be see as a timeline of our entire project

Branching is a strategy to create a copy of a branch, typically a copy of the main branch, and make changes to that code independent of the main branch

Branches are typically used to create new features separate from the main project code/working code to protect it from bugs/being broken. Once the feature you are working is complete, we can combine this new code with the original code in the main branch, otherwise known as merging

There are a couple ways you can create a new branch with git

1. Using the two step: `git branch <name>` `git checkout <branchname>`
2. Using `git checkout -b <name>`

When the new branch is created, it will contain the current version of whatever branch you started on

You can then create, make changes and follow the same git flow from yesterday

When you are ready to combine branches from the feature to your main, use `git merge branchname` keep in mind you want to run this command from the branch you want to merge INTO

Lets add some notes here on the practice branch

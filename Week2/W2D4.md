# Joins

Joins are used to connect and gain information from multiple tables at the same time. Tables are connect to each other using what is known as a join predicate.
There are different types of joins:

-   `(INNER) JOIN`

    -   Used to return the values that only exist in both tables queried

-   `LEFT JOIN`

    -   Returns ALL the values in the first/left table and only the matching values in the second/right table

-   `RIGHT JOIN`

    -   The opposite of a left join
    -   Returns ALL the values in the right/second table and only the matching values in the first/left table

-   `FULL (OUTER) JOIN`

    -   Combination of a left join and a right join
    -   Returns all of the results in both tables regardless of whether or not they have a matching value in the other table

-   General syntax:

```sql
SELECT [columns]
FROM [left table]
LEFT/RIGHT/FULL JOIN [right table]
ON [join predicate];
```

-   `NATURAL`

    -   Natural is a keyword used in addition to a join declaration.
    -   Natural removes the need for a join predicate and simply joins the tables by the same column names

-   Natural Join Syntax:

```sql
SELECT [columns]
FROM [left table]
NATURAL LEFT/RIGHT/FULL JOIN [right table]
```

# Subqueries

Subqueries are essentially queries held within another query

-   Useful for combining queries together to minimize change required by developer or analyst
-   Can go anywhere in the `SELECT`, `FROM`, or `WHERE` clauses
-   Must be contained entirely within parantheses
-   If used with a `WHERE` clause it must be aliased
-   Can be used with DML commands (`INSERT`, `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`)

# Set Operations

Set operations aggregate data together in ways different than joins

-   Used to combine multiple columns worth of data together at once for comparison
-   Sets being operated on need to have the same number of columns selected and those columns must contain similar data types
-   Set operations are done using the `UNION`, `UNION ALL`, `INTERSECT`, and `EXCEPT` commands
    -   `UNION`
        -   Combines columns of data vertically. Takes all the data from the first select and combines it with all the data from the second select without duplicates
    -   `UNION ALL`
        -   Very similar to `UNION`. The only difference is that `UNION ALL` includes duplicates.
    -   `INTERSECT`
        -   Contains the intersection of the two selects. It will only return a column with values that both selects share.
    -   `EXCEPT`
        -   Sometimes called `MINUS` in other versions of SQL
        -   Returns the data from the first select and removes any columns that are also in the other selection
        -   Another way to this about this is the first select minus the intersection it has with the second selection

# Difference between JOIN and UNION

Joins and Unions may seem very similar but they are different in one cardinal way

-   Joins combine data "horizontally". When two tables are joined together the data is compiled so that columns are placed next to each other in a horizontal fashion
-   Unions combine data "vertically". When you union two selections the result sets are stacked vertically into the same number of columns as the selects. If you have one column for the selects it'll take the results from the first query and "stack" them on top of the results from the second query.

# Scalar Functions

Are functions in Postgres/almost any sql which take in a single col at a time, and operate on it

These can be used with SELECT and WHERE

- LENGTH(string(varchar)) return the length of the string
- UPPER(varchar) return the string in all upper case
- LOWER(varchar) return the string in all lower case
- ABS(number) returns the absolute value of the number
- CEILING returns the number rounded up
- FLOOR(num) returns the number rounded down

Better Scalar Function Examples:

# Aggregate Functions

Aggregate functions take in mulitple rows, and combines the values into a single column

- MAX(column) return the max value of all the columns from the selected rows
- MIN(column) return the min value of all the columns from the selected rows
- AVG(column) return the average value of all the columns from the selected rows
- SUM(column) return the sum of the values of the columns from the selected rows
- COUNT(column) returns the total number of elements in that column

These functions are used in the SELECT clause, and cannot be used with the WHERE clause

If more than one column is being selected in the SELECT clause and you are using an aggregate function, you must use GROUP BY keyword

You can also use the HAVING keyword clause with an aggregate function instead of a WHERE

# OWASP Topic - Injection

In our case SQL injection, this was the number one vulnerability for many years

Injection attacks refer to many different things, but they all pertain to:
- When an attacker uses your user input incorrectly on purpose, inputting (typically) some SQL syntax that queries your database for whatever information that are looking for

Example: You have a website that takes in a username and password for your users to login
- The attacker could use those fields to send some SQL query to your server
- Your server receives that information, and puts the received content directly inside of a query sent to the database
- Now instead of trying to log a user in, the attacker sent a perfectly legal query to your database, and can continue sending those queries util they get a feel for you database structure, and know how get any information that like

## How to protrect against Injection

No matter what, we want to make sure that the queries sent from our server to our database are authorized and valid, there are a few ways to do this

- Make sure your application is built properly, there needs to be proper access controls and defense mechanisms to defend again injections
- User query paremeterization. Separate SQL statements from any kind of parameters to be filled by the user. The the parameters fit together into the query like puzzle peices, making it harder to inject code
- Always valide/clean user input coming from your web app. And you can also add a LIMIT clause to your SQL statements to limit data breach, and only have so data returned

With JDBC you can use parameterization with PreparedStatements and CallableStatements

# PL/SQL (Procedural Language SQL):
allows us to create functions and other reusable bits of sql directly in our database
- It will make our sql closer to a programming language

# Functions vs Stored Procedures

## Stored Procedures

Reusable code in PL/SQL that have these properties
- Don't return anything
- May or may not contain IN and OUT parameters
- They allow any DML statement within
- Can call other stored procedures
- Cannot use them IN DML statements


## Functions

Reusable code in PL/SQL that returns a value and has these properties
- Allows cursors
- Should return a single value
- They may or may not contain IN parameters
- Only SELECT statements are allowed
- Can call other functions
- Can be used WITH any other DML
- You have to use a DML enable to call a function

# Views

Virtual tables in SQL, they are created with DQL statements

Advantages of Views:
- Gives access to some, but not all of the data in a table
- Hide the complexity of the database from users
- Allow uses to query normalized tables easier
- Changes to the underlying tables are automatically reflected in the view

## Transaction Control Language (TCL):

Used to manage transactions within a database
- Transaction is any change that happens our tables
- Syntax/Keywords for TCL:
    - COMMIT: this will perminently save any DML operations that occured
    - ROLLBACK: with will completely erase any non commited DML operations
        - Keep in mind, once you commit, you cannot roll back
    - SAVEPOINT: this creates a point to roll back to, but if you commit, it will be gone

## Properties of a transaction

In SQL every transaction must abide by these four properties, these are known as the ACID properties

## Four properties of a transaction

Atomic: All or nothing, the transaction is fully complete, or it doesn't happen at all

Consistency: The tables schema shall remain itact after the transaction

Isolation: Each transaction shall not affect another transaction

Durabilty: Data will persist through system crashes and other issues

# Isolation levels and read phenomena

When an application is working with a database it is very likely that multiple people using the application at the same time, may try to access the same table, same column, or even same entity at the same time

This can cause what is known as read phenomena

## Read Phenomena

Dirty Read: Transaction 1 updates some data but hasn't commited, then a separate transaction reads the uncommitted data

Unrepeatable Read: Transaction 1 reads the same record twice but the state of the record is different. The record was changed by some other transaction, inbetween the reads of transaction 1.

Phantom Read: Transaction 1 executes a query on a set of records, Transaction 2 inserts a new record into the table thats to be in the same set of data as what Transaction 1 queried, then when Transaction 1 executes that same query, there are now more entities than expected

To prevent these Read Phenomena from happening, and keeping the database data synchronized acrossed all users we have different levels of isolation

## Isolation Levels

With JDBC we can have these Isolation Levels to try to mitigate this issue

| Isolation Level  | Dirty Read | Non-Repeatable | Phantom Read |
|----------------- |------------|----------------|--------------|
| Read Uncommitted | Yes        | Yes            | Yes          |
| Read Committed   | No         | Yes            | Yes          |
| Repeatable Read  | No         | No             | Yes          |
| Serializable     | No         | No             | No           |

The Yes/No shows whether or not this Read Phenomena will occur that specific level of isolation

In JDBC if you want to agains these, you can set the Isolation Level with:
- `connection.setTransactionIsolation(Connection.ISOLATIONLEVEL)`

# Indexes

Indexes are used to speed up the look up of rows in a database
- created on individual table columns which you expect to look up often
- primary keys are automatically given indexes

When an index is created on a data base column, a separate data structure is created in the database, typically some type of balanced tree which stores references to the actuals records in the table

Speeds up retrieval time, but lose effiency when inserting into the table

Only create an index/extra indexes, when you anticipate heavy searching for a particular column

## Types of Indexes

There are many types of indexes, however they are split up into two categories: clustered and non-clustered

Clustered indexes: alter the order in which the records are physically stored on the disk. Only one of the indexes can be created per table

Non-clustered indexes: specify a logical ordering of rows, but not not alter the physical ordering of the table. There may be more than one of these per table

Different index types:
- Bitmap
- Dense
- Sparse
- Reverse
- Primary
- Secondary

# OLTP to OLAP

## OLTP Review

Online Transaction Processing

There are our user-oriented applications that serve the main function of the business. These can be web apps or mobile apps or even something like an ATM

These need to have fast response times, generally manage a small amounts of data at a time

Generally, you use some indexed data for fast retrieval

Require frequent or concurrent database backups, however, generally these systems are less concerned about historical data

Run simple queries, involving small amounts of data

These are generally three-layered application, that we have been designing throughout training

## OLAP Overview

Online Analysis Processing

These are going to be our analytical systems, generally for internal business use

The system will need to perform complex queries in order to understand the entirety of the data and draw some conclusions

These types of process are generally highly resource intensive, and can take a significant amount of time

Because of this our data will generally be updated in batches
- End of the quarter or week
- Slowly changing data

These systems will be using denormalized dimensional databases

## Dimensional Databases:

Databases that are:
- Partly denormalized
- Designed for easy queries
- Using the star of snowflak schema

# Messaing Review

Messaging, and messaging queues allow us to implement a pub/sub design pattern with different components of our systems

The pub/sub design pattern, and messaging allows us to develop in a more async way, whenever we get data, we can simply subscribe to it, or choose to ignore it if we want

Messaging services will typically use queues, which are a data structure where the elements/pieces of data are consumed in a first in first out manner

# Data Lifecycle, Applications, And Messaging Queues
## How do they all fit together?

When it comes to data, our application will constantly be interacting with our users and in essence, generating data for us

Outside of our customer facing applications, AKA possibly a OLTP, most businesses also have internal tools they have written to gather data to be stored in their databases, and they may also gather data from outside sources

The business could implement a messaging queue between their data gathering tools, the client facing application, and many other tools to feed data into some other internal tool to do something with that data

The internal tool can subscribe each time a message comes through the queue with data, and then take that data and start our ETL process

During the ETL process we can transform the data to conform to whatever data warehouse we are storing data in. And laod the data into said warehouse so the company can run analysis later.

Finally, the internal OLAP system, can use the data warehouse we have been loading with data to give our company insights that we may need to make decisions moving foward

# Functional Components in React

React allows you to create components based off of functions
- These are simplier, and more straight forward to write
- With the inclusion of Hooks, functional components are now (almost) as powerful as more bulky class based components
- The only thing with funcion based components, is that they must return JSX/TSX

# Event Handling in React

Event handing in React is similar to HTML, however, with JSX you must use camelCase for the event name, and pass the handler as a JS reference rather than a string

## Synthetic Events
cross browser wrapper around browsers native event, this is used when an event occurs in React

Used because it is capable of pooling, which means the SyntheticEvent Objects are reused to improve performance, however, issues can arise because after the callback is called the properties are nullified

## Hooks

built in functions that allow us to "hook" into React state and lifecycle methods from functional components

This gave function components the same amount of power as class based

## Basic Hooks: useState, useEffect, useContext

useState:
- allows you to store and mutate state inside of a function component
- declare a state variable and a mutator inside of square brackets, then use the `useState(defaultVal)` to set the state orginally
    - `const [state, setState] = useState("")`
- use the declared mutator to change and update the state
- with useState, the state does not have to be an object like it does in classes

useEffect:
- allows you to perform some logic at a specific point in the applications life
- its takes in a callback function that performs logic
- it can be used to watch for specific events/changes in state to perform some logic
- If you only want it to run once at the beginning of the components life, you can give it an empty array
- You can watch specific state members, by adding them to the array

useContext:
- used to access values being stored in the ContextAPI
- Context is a way to store application state
    - However, we will be using Redux instead

## Lifting State

As previously mentioned, data can only flow one way in React, and props are read only, so we cannot change the state of a parent class from a child class

However, we can "Lift State" by passing a child component a funciton as a prop, that changes the state of the parent component

Lifting state is useful when a common parent/ancestor is shared across multiple other components that are sharing common values

There are limitations when applications become too large and the entire application needs to keep track of the state, it becomes difficult to manage. However, we will soon learn of a technology to handle this for us

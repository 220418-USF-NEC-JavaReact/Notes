## Data Manipulation Language

Used to change data inside of the database/table
- Often refered to as the CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
    - This is the theoretical construct of the mininum you should be able to do with a table in SQL
- Syntax/Keywords for DML:
    - INSERT: add data into the table
    - SELECT: retrieve data from the table
    - UPDATE: used to update data in the table
    - DELETE: useed to remove data from the table

# Introduction to JDBC

Java Database Connectivity, allows us to write Java code to interact with relational databases

## JDBC Classes and Interfaces

There are several classes and interfaces commonly used with JDBC, which can be found in java.sql package and javax.slq package

- `DriverManager` class - to make a connection with a database driver
- `Datasource` interface - an alternative to the DriverManager
- `Connection` interface which represents a connection to the database
- `SQLException` class: a general exception that is thrown when something goes wrong
- `Statement` interface used to execute SQL statements
- `PreparedStatements` interface used to execute a precompiled SQL statement
- `CallableStatement` interfaced used to execture a stored procedure on the database
- `ResultSet` interface that represents the data returned from the database

## Connection Interface

To create a connection, you use the DriverManager.getConnection() method, with these paremeters
- URL to the database (jdbc:postgresql://hostname:port/databasename)
- username
- password

## Statements and ResultSets

We use Statements to setup/start our transactions with the database in Java

We use ResultSets to return the data from the database, to get a ResultSet object, you execute the Statement you created with a SQL string

You must manually loop through the result set data to create the java objects yourself

## Setting up the Database Driver and a Connection

To establish a connection to the database, you will need what is known as a driver
- These are database specific
- You can get them through the maven repository
- We will need the postgres driver

# Normalization

Refers to reducing redundancy of data, and improving data integrity and consistency

We focus on the first three forms of normalization

## First Normal Form

Must have a primary key

No duplicate values in rows

Atomic Columns (break up columns as small as possible)

## Second Normal Form

Must be first normal form

All attributes must depend of the primary

## Third Normal Form

Must be second normal form

There are no transisitive dependencies, data should only relate to the primary, not some other column in the table

### The key (1NF), the whole key (2NF), and nothing but the key (3NF), so help me Codd

# Forming Relationships with Multiplicity in a Database

Multiplicity is the relationship between entries in different tables, defined by a foreign key constraints

## Foreign Key
- Makes a relationship between table
- Do not need unique, however can be
- Can be made out of one or more columns
    - A foreign key made out of mulitple columns is called a composite key

## Four types of multiplicity

1. One-to-many: one entry in the first table can be mapped to many entries in the second table
    - The foreign key in the first table is allowed to map to multiple entries in the second table
2. Many-to-one: this is the opposite of one to many
3. Many-to-many: Many entries in the first table can be mapped to many entries in the second table
    - These are implemented with a junction table
4. One-to-one: a single entry in the first table is mapped to a single entry in the second table
    - The foriegn key is going to be unique

## Referential Integrity

- A foreign key is the reference to the relationship in multiplicity, and the rule ensures that a referenced record always exists
- You are not allowed to delete an entry if that entry is depended on by another table
- However, you can use cascade delete, which will delete all children and parent entries

## Auto-incrementing Columns

We can make our primary key automatically increment with the `generated always as identity`

# Reading an ERD

Entity Relationship Diagram, its going to illistrate out tables relate to one another

We have three main components of an ERD

Entity:
- What is the table representing

Attributes:
- What are the columns of the table

Relationships:
- How are these tables related/connected

## Data Query Language (DQL):

This one is often debated, however it exists in Postgres so we cover it
- The debate itself is if it should be its own sub-language, or just part of DML
- Syntax/Keywords for DQL:
    - SELECT:
    - Typically it is talking about SELECT that is being used with other keywords to specify exact results

## Other notible keywords used with DQL

WHERE: used to narrow down the query results of your select statement

ORDER BY: used to sort data returned by the select statement by a specific row

GROUP BY: used to group rows by a column, typically used with aggregate functions

HAVING: similar to where clause, but used in conjunction with an aggregate function

## Aliases

In SQL you can give a table or column in a table a temporary name with an alias

These are often used to make column names of result sets more readible, and often used in joins to help identify what you are joining

To give a column or table an alias you use the `as` keyword

## Git Branching Basics

Every project has at least one branch known as the main branch, this is where the working code is stored. The HEAD points at the most recent commit you have made, as you make commits this pointer/head points to the next commit, and so and so forth.

Our main branch can be see as a timeline of our entire project

Branching is a strategy to create a copy of a branch, typically a copy of the main branch, and make changes to that code independent of the main branch

Branches are typically used to create new features separate from the main project code/working code to protect it from bugs/being broken. Once the feature you are working is complete, we can combine this new code with the original code in the main branch, otherwise known as merging

There are a couple ways you can create a new branch with git

1. Using the two step: `git branch <name>` `git checkout <branchname>`
2. Using `git checkout -b <name>`

When the new branch is created, it will contain the current version of whatever branch you started on

You can then create, make changes and follow the same git flow from yesterday

When you are ready to combine branches from the feature to your main, use `git merge branchname` keep in mind you want to run this command from the branch you want to merge INTO

Lets add some notes here on the practice branch

# Methods

A method is a named block of code declared inside of a class
- A function attached to an object

A method must:
- Be declared inside of a class
- Have a return type, if you want the method to return nothing you can use the `void` return type
- It must have a name, followed parenthesis
    - Optionally you can pass in parameters into these parenthesis
- The start and end of the code block are denoted by curly braces

### We use the `return` keyword to tell our method to return a value

java
```
returnType name(parameters){
    logic goes here
}
```

Parameters are values passed into a method
- If you declare a method to take parameters you MUST pass the method those paremeters, otherwise it will result in a compilation error
- We can pass as many parameters to a method as we like, they just have to separated by a commas

Var args is a notation in java to pass an unset amount of parametes of a single datatype
- Uses the `...` notation
- There can only be one varargs in a method, and it MUST be the last parameter
- Varargs gets converted to an array behind the scenes (more on arrays later)
- `method(int ... values){}`

## The `main` method

A special method in Java which is used to run the program
- Its called main because that what the Java developers called it
- It will always have the same syntax, so remember it!
    - `public static void main(String args[]){}`

## Constructors

To create a new object we must use the `new` keyword with a constructor

Are special methods in Java which are used to initialized instances of objects
- They don't have a return type
- Share the name of the class being created
- We can give them specific values to set inside of our object

Ever class in Java implicitly gets given a constructor at run time, this is what we consider the default contructor
- The default constructor will set all of your class memberss to their default state

There are also two other types of constructors
- The no argument constructor
- Parameterized Constructor

No argument constructor is simply a constructor a programmer physically writes, but takes no arguments
- It is NOT the same as the default

Parameterized is a constructor the programmer physically writes, but takes in arguments

- The `this` keyword is often used inside of paremeterized constructors to set variables that belong to the specific object we are creating

If you explicitly created ANY constructor inside of your class, the default constructor will no longer be generated at runtime

You can have one constructor in a class, call another constructor in the same class by using the `this()`, this is called constructor chaining.

# Arrays

An object which stores elements of the same data type
- The elements are stored via index, in an array each index is located next to one another in memory
- Array indexes start at 0, you access specific elemnts in the array by these indexes
- The array must be given a size when instantiated, and you cannot resize
- The `length` property gives programmers access to the size of the array

There are multiple ways to declare an array
- `datatype arr[]`
- `datatype[] arr`

There are multiple ways to instantiate an array
- `datatype arr[] = new datatype[size]`
- `int arr[] = {1,2,3,4,5}`;

Arrays are considered objects, meaning we can store arrays inside of arrays, making multideminsional arrays

- These can be used to model matrixes, and be used to solve dynmic programming problem

To create a multiple dimensional array, we just add more square brackets

- `datatype[][] arr`

The first set of indexes in our multi-dimensional array are storing arrays
- Theses are similar to rows and columns
- `dataType[row][col] arr`

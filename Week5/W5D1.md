# Threads and Concurency

Concurency refers to breaking up a task into different parts that can be executed independent of one another, in any order, without affecting the final outcome

## Threads

a thread is a subset of a process that is also an indpendendent sequence of execution

- Threads of the main process will run in the same memory space, but they are managed indenpendently by the scheduler

Every thread has its own call stack where it stores local variable references, but since they share the same heap memory multiple threads can access the same objects in memory

Multithreading is the idea of using multiple threads in an application to achieve parallelism

- Each thread can perform its own task, increasing effiency

In Java we achieve this multithreading with the `Thread` class and the `Runnable` interface

In general it is best practice to not attempt to implement multithreading yourself, because it can lead to issues we will speak on later
- You are encouraged to use frameworks, or API's that implement the multithreading for you

# States of Threads

Threads follow a lifecycle with six different states

1. New: Newly created thread, that has not start execution
2. Runnable: the thread is either running, or it is ready for execution but waiting for its resource allocation
3. Blocked: waiting to aquire a monitor lock to enter, or re-enter a block of synchronized code
4. Waiting: waiting for some thread to perform an action
5. Timed_Waiting: waiting for some other thread to perform some action for a specified amount of time
6. Terminated: the thread has completed executing

![Thread lifecycle](https://www.javatpoint.com/images/thread-life-cycle.png)

Threads also have priorties which signify which order that they should be run. The thread class contains a few static variables for priority

- MIN_PRIORITY = 1
- NORM_PRIORITY = 5 (Default)
- MAX_PRIORITY = 10

# Custom Threads in Java

You can create your own threads in Java in one of two ways, extend the Thread class, or implement the Runnable interface

## Thread Class

Creating a thread with extending the Thread class will grant you access to the thread class methods:

- getters and setters for id, name, and priority
- interrupt() to explicitly interupt the thread
- isAlive, isInterupted, and is Daemon to test the state of the thread
- join() to wait for the thread to finish executing, then join it back into the main thread
- start() actually begin the thread executing after instantation

To create/run the thread:

1. Create a class that extends Thread
2. Implement whatever logic you want inside of the run() method
3. Create an instance of that custom thread object and start with the .start() method

## Runnable Interface

Creating a thread with implementing the Runnable interface, will give you the freedom to extend any other class you might want, at the loss of the built in Thread methods

To create and run a thread this way:
1. Create a class that implements the Runnable interface
2. Implement the run() method
3. To create and run this thread, you must create a generic thread object `new Thread()` and pass the runnable class you just created into the constructor of that generic thread object
4. Then you would call start() on that generic thread object you created above

# Thread Problems:

There are issues that can occir if you try to implement multithreading yourself. One of these is called Deadlock

Deadlock occurs when two or more threads are blocking trying to access the same resource, waiting for one another. Neither thread can continue executing, so the program halts indefinitely. This is synchronization comes in

Synchronization is the capability to control the access of mulitple threads to any shared resource

To do this we use the `synchronized` keyword. The synchronized keyword enforces that only one thread can access a resource at a given time

Another problem multithreaded program run into is the producer consumer problem

## Producer Consumer Problem

In this problem we have a fixed size buffer, that is shared between the producer and the consumer

- The producer thread adds to the buffer
- The consumer threads takes away from the buffer

The problem is that data should only be added if the buffer is not full, and data should only be consumed if the buffer is not empty

To solve this we can use the above `synchronized` keyword to synchronize communication between the threads and the buffer, as well as the .wait() and .notify() methods to communicate across threads

- .wait() can pause the consumer depending on the amount of data in the buffer
- .notify() can send a notification/message to each thread when the buffer is empty/full

# Reflections API

The Reflection API allows you to peak into classes, and modify theirs states and behaviors at runtimes

The required classes are provided under the java.lang.reflect

Gives us information about the class, including method names, method return types, and even which annotations are used inside of the class
- This is typically be used in frameworks, for example, in JUnit reflections is used to detect the @Test annotations, and know to run those methods as test cases

- Spring uses reflections under the hood to know how to control our classes and configure your application automatically

# Intro to Spring

Spring is a family of frameworks which can be used to rapidly create loosely coupled Java appliations
- Loosely coupled meaing, the dependencies can easily be swapped between classes without much hassle

It is an inversion of control container, that provides flexible infrustructure to Java applications

Its main inversion of control is called dependency injection

Spring enable developers to build java applications utilizing POJO's and applying enterprise services, to those POJOS as needed. This allows developers to focus on business logic, while Spring mangages the infrustructures needs (aka the dependencies between your classes)

## Spring Modules:

The modules you need to know about from spring:
- Core
- Web/MVC
- ORM
- AOP
- Security

# Spring IOC (Inversion of Control) Container, and Dependency Injection

Inversion of control, is a design pattern in which the control over certain parts of object-oriented programming is inverted to achieve loose coupling

We are essentially giving control to some other part of our application

IOC container is repsonsible for instantiating, configuring, and assmebling every spring is managing

The classes that we tell Spring to manage for us are called Beans

And the IOC container gathers this information from an XML file called beans.xml or applicationcontext.xml

The specific control we are handing to spring, is the ability to inject the dependencies we need in each component called a bean

## The two IOC Containers

There are two types of IOC containers in Spring
- BeanFactory is the simplest/oldest
- ApplicationContext is an extended version of the BeanFactory, with more features
    - integration with spring aop
    - event propagation
    - message resource handling
    - application layer specific context

# Dependency Injection

removes dependencies from a program, by providing the configuraion in an external file

This loosely couple your code, making it easier to test, and implement in a wider variety of environments

## Types of Dependency Injection in Spring

Two offical ways of dependency injection in Spring:

Constructor Injection: the dependencies are injected into the constuctor
- Generally known as the most secure, enables implementation of immutable objects

```java
public class DIExample {
    private Dependency injectMe;

    //Spring passes the dependency object for us
    public DIExample(Dependency d){
        this.injectMe = d;
    }
}
```

Setter Inject: the dependencies of the class are injected through a setter after the no-args constructor was called

- Allows for partial dependencies, more flexible than constructor, and can be used to resolve circular dependencies

```java
public class DIExample {
    private Dependency injectMe;

    public DIExample(){}

    //Spring sets the dependency object for use here
    public void setInjectMe(Dependency d){
        this.injectMe = d;
    }
}
```

An unoffical way to inject dependencies in Spring is through Field Injection, it is still technically possible, but not best practice

# Bean Lifecycle in Spring

Beans are managed by the BeanFactory or ApplicationContext and have a LifeCycle, here is a high level overview

1. Beans are first instantiated
2. Their properties are set
3. Any associated interfaces or objects are made aware of their existence
4. The bean is made aware of any associated interfaces as well
5. Any other methods, particulary custom startup methods are invoked
6. The bean is ready for use
7. Once the bean is no longer being used, it is marked for removal, and a destroy method is invoked for the bean
8. Any custom destroy methods are created
9. Bean is destroyed

# Scopes of a bean

In the case of beans, scope can be seen as a subsection of a lager application, which certain defined values, properties, and objects

There are six scopes that you can apply to a bean

1. Singleton: default, there is a single isntance of the bean per IOC container
2. Prototype: a single bean definition is scoped to a number of object instances
3. Request: a single bean definition is scoped to lifecycle of an HTTP request
4. Session: a single bean definition is scoped to an HTTP session
5. Global Session: a single bean definition is scoped to a global HTTP session
6. Application: a single bean defintion is scoped to ServletContext

# Configuring you Application with Spring:

Our IOC container needs some way to know how to inject dependencies for us

We have two ways of achieving this:
- XML files
- Annotations in Java classes

# Spring Annotations

-   `@Autowired` - Spring Annotation used to inject bean dependencies as needed, based on bean type.
-   `@Bean` - Spring annotation which plays the same role as the <bean/> element in an XML-based configuration, and you can specify an identifier for these beans with the use of the id (or name) property.
-   `@Component` - Generic [stereotype annotation](./stereotypes.md) used to declare an object as a bean.
-   `@ComponentScan` - Spring Annotation which specifies path locations for defined beans to be used for potential injection.
-   `@Configuration` - Spring annotation indicates a class file used to manage bean configurations using Java configuration similar to the Application Context file for an XML or annotation based configuration.
-   `@Inject` - Standard Java annotation used to inject bean dependencies as needed. Equivalent to Spring's `@Autowired` annotation.
-   `@Named` - Standard Java annotation for disambiguating beans based on bean name. Equivalent to Spring's `@Qualifier` annotation. Additionally can be used as an equivalent to Spring's `@Component` annotation to define beans as well.
-   `@Qualifier` - Spring Annotation which can be used in conjunction with `@Autowired` to disambiguate multiple beans of a defined type.
-   `@Required` - Standard Java annotation which indicates that an affected bean property must be populated at configuration time through an explicit property value in the bean's definition.
-   `@Resource` - Standard Java Annotation used to inject bean dependencies based on bean name, rather than type.

# Autowiring and Autowiring types

Autowiring allows spring to figure what beans need injected into what other beans automatically

## Autowiring types:

"no": means spring will not autowire, this is default

"byType: means spring will autowire by looking that the class' property datatypes and matches them to beans in the IOC container. It uses setters to inject the beans

"constructor" works similarly to byType, except it uses a constructor with the most disitinct depdendencies, it then matches those by type to the beans in the IOC container

"byName" looks at the class' property variable names, and finds means in the container with the same names, it uses setter injection

# Stereotype Annotations

Used in conjunction with autowiring, so Spring can scan classes and look for one of these annotations, if it see a class with a stereo type annotation, it will automatically create a bean for you

@Component: is the most generic stereotype used to declare an object as a bean

@Repository: is used to mark a class as being used to store data or access data (it also does the above)

@Service: is used to mark a class as being used as a service, and the above as well

@Controller: is used to mark a class as a Spring MVC controller which allows the use of hanlder mapping annotations

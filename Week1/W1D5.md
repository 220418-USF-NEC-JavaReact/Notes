# IDE's

Are Integrated Development Environments, which create a nice working area for developers

For Java there are many including, Eclipse, STS, Intellij and more, we will be using intellij because thats what the client wants

## Installing a Linter SonarLint on Intellij

Sonar Lint is a free, open source linting tool. A linting tool/linter is a software tool which, when integretated with an IDE can provide increased feedback to the developer

Traditional IDE tool utilize built in linters to indentify code syntax errors, and exceptions, but Sonar Lint provides further suggestions by recognizing code smells

## Code Quality Analysis and Code Smells

Code Quality Analysis tools are programs specifically designed to expose errors as well as code smells

Code Smells:
- Vulnerabilities
    - Data security issues
- Bugs
    - Issues with the functionality of code
- Maintainability
    - Confusing or hard to maintain code
    - Repeated instances of code
    - Unused imports
    - Empty code blocks
    - Unaddressed autmated code comments

Intellij also allows you to install it directly in the IDE which is what I will be doing

# Garbage Collection

Java automatically removes objects from memory when there is no longer a reference to them

You cannot expliticly call for garbage collection, but you can suggest

- System.gc()
- Runtime.getRuntime().gc()
- System.runFinalize()
    - Finalize is an inherited method from the object class, you can override it to implement logic to run before your object is destroyed

```java
Object o1 = new Object(); //1. a new object is created in memory, and var o1 is referencing it
Object o2 = new Object(); //2. Another new object is created in memory, and var o2 is referencing it
Object o3 = o1; //3. We create a new reference to the first object
o2 = o3; // 4. Now the second variable is pointing at the first object in memory, there are no references to object 2 in memory anymore
//Now at some point, Java will see that the second object has no references, and will eventally remove it
```

# Java passing method parameters

## Java uses pass by value

Pass by Value vs Pass by Reference

Pass by Value is where we take a copy of the variable/object/whatever we are passing into the method and using that

Pass by Reference is where we take the actual refence to the object/variable/whatever we are passing into the method

# Intro to TDD and Unit Testing

Test Driven Development (TDD) is a process of writing tests for your code, then implementing the code to pass those tests
- This help increase our code coverage

## Red/Green Testing

Red/Green testing is assocaited with TDD, and it is the process of writing a test befroe the code which will result in red

Write the code to pass that specific test which will result in a green

Then you write a new test, that is more specific, run it, will fail back to red

Refactor your code to pass that new test (green)

The general process can be broken down into 5 steps

1. Write a unit test
2. Run the test (it will fail)
3. Write code to pass the test
4. Refactor/write a more advanced test
5. Refactor the code and repeat

# Unit Tests

Unit Testing is the testing of individual software components in isolation from the rest of the software

It can also sometimes be called White Box testing:
- A testing method in which the internal design of the module/unit being tested is known to the tester

Unit testing can find if/where something goes wrong in your code
- This helps reduce debugging time because you know where to look for an issue in your code
- It also increse code coverage, because you should be testing each individual unit/module in your code
- It increases confidence in changing and maintaining your code

It is best practice to not only test edge cases, but also include negative test cases

# JUnit and Mockito

## JUnit is a Java framework for unit testing

Uses annotations to create tests and setup testing environments
- `@Test` - declares a method as a test method
- `@BeforeClass` - declare a method to be run before any of the test methods get one, it will be called upon once per test suite
- `@Before` - declare a method to be run once before ever testing method in the test suite
- `@After` - declare a method to be run once after every testing method in the test suite
- `@AfterClass` - declare a method to be run once after all of the tests of been run in the test suite

JUnit also has built in static methods to use in your testing methods to verify that the state of your application is what is expected
- `assertTrue()`
- `assertFalse()`
- `assertEquals()`
- `assertNotEquals()`
- `assertThat()`


# Mockito is a Java framework that allows us to mock the functionality of other methods

This allows for black box testing
- Where you don't know the functionality of the given module, we just need valid out from it
- This is extremely useful for testing methods that rely on the output of other methods
- You replace the dependency of the other method with mocks and stubs

A Stub is a fake class that comes with preprogrammed return values

A Mock is a fake class that be examined after the test is finished to see how it interacted with the class under the test

## Mocking Objects in Mockito

Mockito uses Annotations to implement its mocking, to mock an object you put `@Mock` above it

- Mocking an object gives you the ability to prevent the object from doing something, and you get to tell it what to do instead
- This is useful when one peice of code relies on another module, you can have a garenteed return from the depedent module by using mocking

If you have an object that requires other modules, you can use `@InjectMocks` above the object to give it the dependencies needed

Finally, to be sure the mocking is going to work, you will need to enable Mockito annotationas, to do this you create a mehod to run before every test, and inside call `MockitoAnnotations.openMocks(this)`

## Spying With Mockito

Spying in Mockito allows you to watch specific methods of class to be called, if the methods you are spying on are called you can override the logic to the method

This is useful for testing to be sure you don't make database calls

## Testing for exceptions using Junit

In Junit you can test to see if an exception was thrown by using `@Test(expected = Exception.class)

If you use the above convention, the method being test MUST throw that exception, otherwise the test will fail

# Logging with Log4J

Logging records events that occur during the execution of your program
- They allow for developers to access information about applications for which they do not have direct access to
- Without logs developers would have no idea what went wrong, when the application crashes

We will be using Log4j for logginf
- Log4j is a reliable, fast, and flexible logging framework for java, supported by apache
- It is commonly used to record application events, log granual debugging information, and write exceptions events to files

Log4J allows us to use various logging levels, and configure thresholds to determine which logging messages are saved/recored to the log file or console

Logging Levels:
1. ALL => All levels
2. DEBUG => designated for fine grained informational events that are most useful to debing the application
3. INFO => informational messages that highlight the progress of the application
4. WARN => designated for potentially harmful events (incorrect input)
5. ERROR => designated for error events that might still allow the application to continue running (exceptions)
6. FATAL => application cannot recover, very severe
7. OFF => we will see no logging at all

# Introduction to OWASP Top 10

The OWASP Top 10 are the most critical security risks to web applications

- OWASP stands for Open Web Application Security Project, and it is a non-profit foundation dedicated to improving the security of software

The OWASP top 10 are important to know because they give orgainiztions a priority over which risks they should focus on

## The OWASP Top 10 Standards

- Insufficient Logging And Monitoring
- Injection
- Cross Site Scripting
- Broken Authentication
- Using Componetns with Know Vulnerabilities
- Sensitive Data Exposure
- Security Misconfiguration
- XML External Entities
- Broken Access Control
- Insecure Deserialization

# OWASP Insufficient Logging and Monitoring

Insufficient Logging is just as it sounds, either not, or not frequently logging and monitoring those logs

Logging is the recording of a lod of certain events that occur during the life of an application

Monitoring is actually looking at those logs, and taking an action if needed

## How attackers can take advantage of Insufficient Logging and Monitoring

For example if an attacker has a list of 100 usernames from your application, they could try to log into each using a script that also holds 1000's of commonly used passwords

- We should be looking things like when users try to login/failed attempts, and should also be monitoring the logs to see things like brute force attacks happening
- If we are monitoring the logs, we may see this attack early enough to let the users know, and try to protect them

## Consider this when logging

Sufficient Content: when you look at a log, you know exacrly whats going on, but theres no unnecessary info that a hacker could use

Good Format: organized for that is easily readible/consumable. Too much cotent is not a good thing

Integrity controls: These will usually be in place if you ever send your log file to an external source. If your log content gets changed, you want to be notified that the integritity isn't there anymore.

Response Plan: You can monitor the logs all you want, but you need an actuasl plan in place incase something does actually occur

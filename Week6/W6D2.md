# Dynamic Environment Configuration Through Profiles

Allows us to map beans to different profiles, allowing us to have different versions of our beans

- different database connections for different environments

This allows for best practices of separating your working environments, from development, testing, and production

To map a bean to a specific profile/enviornment, simply annotate that class with `@ActiveProfile("environmentName")`

You could also set the environment in the application.properties with `spring.properties.active-environment`

Then you setup the profile properties in a separate propeties named `applictation-environment.properties`

# Intro to Integration Testing

In a software project we have many different modules, in a team setting many these will be implemented by different people

We have already spoken about testing each one of these modules with unit testing, but the next step after unit testing integration testing

Integration testing is where we combine each of our modules/units into a larger system, and creating tests for that larger subset of the system

The purpose of this level is to expose defects in the interaction between these software modules/layers when they are integrated

In java we can use the same framework we were already using for Unit testing to integration testing, aka JUnit

## Two ways of Integration Testing

1. Use mockito and other mocking libraries provided by spring to mock the dependences between the different components we are ingretation testing. Typically we would be testing the flow from the controller down

2. Use Spring Boot profiles and environments to setup a separate testing environment and mock nothing. You will acutally be mkaing calls to a testing database to make sure everything worked as expected

# SDLC (Software Development Lifecycle)

Outlines the process to plan, create, test and deploy information systems and applications

## SDLC Follows these 7 general steps:

1. Requirements Phase
2. Analysis Phase
3. Design Phase
4. Development Phase
5. Testing Phase
6. Integration and Deployment Phase
7. Maintenance Phase

There are two main approaches to SDLC:
- Waterfall
- Agile

## WaterFall

Waterfall is a linear approach, as you finish one phase, you move onto the next, and there is no going back

## Typical Timeline of Waterfall

- Requirements: 2-4 weeks
- Planning/Analysis: 2-4 weeks
- Design: 1-4 months
- Implementation/Development: 6-12+ months
- Testing: 6 month, but actually ongoing
- Deployment: 1-3 weeks
- Maintenance: lifetime of the application

## Advantages of Waterfall
- Easy to manage workflow
- Well suited for small teams, or short term projects, that will not require any requirement changes
- Gernerally it will result in faster delivery
- Process and results are easily documented
- Easy to adapt to shifting teams since the steps are clearly laid

## Disadvantages of Waterfall
- Very inflexible and ineffiecient
- Not ideal for large team projects
- Testing does not begin until development is complete

## Agile

Agile is a iterative approach, you go through every step of SDLC in 2-4 week sprints

Agile is ideology, not a concrete SDLC methodoloy

Agile is becoming the more widely accepted and utilize method of SDLC because of its core values

- Indivuals and Interactions over processes and tools
- Working sotfware over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

## Advantages of Agile

- Client collaboration is generally regarded as positive
- Agile team cultires tend to stay more self-organized and motivated
- Overall quality of product is normally higher because of the iterative approach
- Less risk in development process due to the incremental approach

## Disadvantages

- Not as useful for small development projects
- Higher costs associate with the Agile workflow
- Development time can bloat if managed poorly, or requirements are not clear
- Requires more experience members during the planning and management of projects

# Agile/Scrum Concepts

Scrum is the simplest Agile Framework/implementation of Agile, it enforces ceremonies lead by a leader who ensures the team is following Scrum practices

## Scrum Artifacts:
- Product Owner: holds the authority over the project, a represtentative of the client/customer
- Scrum Master: the person who mediates all of the meeting, and goes between the client and the team (team leader)
- Project Backlog: holds all the current requirements for the project
- Sprint Backlog: requirements that we want to complete during this sprint
- User Stories: individual requirements
- Epic: a group of related features that is broken down into multiple user stories
- Sprint: a brief period of development (between 2 to 4 weeks) which generally cumulates in a release of related features
- Velocity: the sum of story points of all user stories completed that sprint

## Story Pointing

Story pointing allows teams to keep track of the progess (velocity) of their project/sprint, and create burndown charts

Burndown Charts: chart of the amount of stort points that have been completed each day vs the number of points remaining

![burndown](https://www.worldofagile.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/ReleaseBurnDown.png)

What you would do, is when creating your user stories, you would apply points to each depending on difficult/trivial your felt each one is

When assigning story points, it should be a team discussion, that includes consideration of Risk, Complexity, and Repetition of the user story

Couple of ways to assign story points:
1. Stat poker
2. Using fib sequence
    - 1: trivial
    - 2: easy
    - 3: medium
    - 5: difficult...

## Scrum Ceremonies

meetings used during the life cycle of the sprint in the project

Sprint Planning:
- Include the entire dev team, scrum master, and product owner
- Happen once before every new sprint
- Determine the scope, goals, and metrics of the sprint

Daily Standup/Scrums:
- This is a daily meeting lead by the scrum master
- Takes aprox. 15 minutes
- Everyone tells what they are working on, what they might be stuck on, and what their goals are for the day

Sprint Review:
- Everyone is invited to this meeting
- Review what the team accomplished at the end of the sprint
- Gain feedback

Sprint Retrospective:
- Scrum master reviews metric, and assess any ineffiencies
- Plans to make improvements as a team

# Cloud Computing Review

## Advantages of Cloud Computing

Pay as you go
- Lower pay as you go prices due to economies of scale

Automatically scale your resources up and down

Easily and quickly realocate resources

Less startup costs (no need to buy tons of server equipment)

Deploy your application globally in seconds

We are utilzing Amazon Web Services as our cloud computing provider

AWS allows for pay as you go, with free tier options

AWS is also available in over 24 regions, with 77 availablity

# AWS Review

## AWS Region
geographical location with a collection of availablity vones

## Availability zone:
a physical data center in a region

# AWS EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

AWS EC2 is a service that provides secure, resizeble compute capacity in the cloud. In is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers

An Amazon EC2 Provides:
- A virtual computing environ, (you can host you java appliation here)
- Preconfigured environment templates called AMI (Amazon Machine Images)
    - These contain virtual images of a server, that contains the OS, and software you might want/need for hosting an application
- You can configure the CPU, MEMORY, Storage, etc to be whatever you need
    - The more resources added the more expensize
- It has secure login with ssh keys, and firewalls to prevent unwanted traffic

The firewalls are known as **Security Groups**
- These are set at an instance level, it holds a series of white listed ips we are explicitly allowing

Elastic Block Storage (EBS): provides block level storage volumes for use with EC2's
- If you need extra storage, you can setup, and attach one of these to your EC2

# Scaling an applications

We have two ways of scaling an application, one is vertical, and one horizontal

Vertical Scaling: giving the server the application is running on more resources, more cpu cores, more memory etc

Horizontal Scaling: is spinning up extra servers, and running your application across several resources, with special routing between them

AWS EC2's can use honizontal scaling automatically

## EC2 Autoscaling

Allows you to scale up or down resources for your application automatically to mantain availablity of your application

AWS provides horizontal scaling

## Benefits of Autoscaling:
- Improved Fault Tolerance: detect a fault instance and replace it with a new one
- Increased Application Availablity: insure your application has the right amount of compute power at any given time
- Lower costs: only need to increase the number of instances when you need it, instead of paying the increased number the entired time

## Autoscaling groups
Collections of EC2 instances with similar characterstics
- You can use these to increase the number of instance to improve performance
- You can use these to descreate the number of instances to reduce cost
- You can use these as fixed amounts of instances

Launch configurations allows you to set certain parameters used for autoscaling

Scaling Plans tell how and when to scale, there are three plans
- Scheduled Scaling
- Dynamic Scaling
- Predictive Scaling

More information, and how to set it up can be found here:

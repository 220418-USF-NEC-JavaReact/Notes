# Intro to DevOps

DevOps is the combination of Development and Operations

It is a set of practicee and methodologies designed to combine the production/writing of code and the deployment/maintence of the code into one streamlined process

The primary goal of DevOps is to expedite the lifecycle of an applications development, particulary through automation of tasks

This can help save money and decrease the time between releases

Typically 5 steps/phases of devops:

1. Source Code Control: Producing code and pushing to a repo
2. Building and testing automation: Test basic functionality of code, generally writing unit tests, and creating a new working build
3. Deploying to staging: Deployment of working builds to a temporary enviornment (production like)
4. Acceptance Testing: Undergo more complext testing, (system tests, and end to end) within the temporary environment
5. Deployment of the Build: Migrate working builds to the production so users can access it

## DevOps and Agile

Adoption of the Agile processes can provide a stepping stone for the establishment of a working DevOps pipeline

The processes of Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, and Continuous Deployment are used to automate the phases of the Devops as mush as possible

# Continuous Integration (CI):

CI is the process of regularly and consistently merging code into a central repository and reviewing new code to ensure that it integrates well within the previously established code base

It is the first and most fundamental step in creating a autonomous development pipeline

It is a development team mentality, and it is achieved when all members of the development team practice consisten merging of code into the central repository.

Benefits of CI:
- Ensures that the entire teams works on the most up to date version of the code
- Detect broken builds quickly
- Code can be tested easily by creating separate test or development branches
- Reduces the overall rish in development a larger code base has already been established
- Reduces the overal amount of bugs in the project

# Continuous Delivery (CD):

CD allows for the building, management, and testing of produced software to be automated, such that deployments can be performed at the push of a button

It is dependent upon the implementation of CI, it can take code that is being pushed regularly, build it, test it, and deploy it to a production like enviornment where we can run more tests

The application is automatically ready for release, and can be released with the push of a button

Benefits of CD:
- Reduced risk in deployment
- Predictible progress
- Frequent feedback

# Continuous Deployment (CD):

This is the final step in completely automating your software production

It will automatially build, test, and deploy your software to the production environment, whenever you push a new release to the main branch

It is essentially the final addition to Continuous Delivery, it is the fully automated pipeline

Benefits of CD:
- Even faster development process, without the need to pause for deployment
- New releases are less risky, as small bugs can easily be recognized and fixed in production by just pushing the hotfix to the main branch
- Increased communication and regular streams of improvement are generally seen as good thing from customers

Costs/risks of CD:
- Establishing a Continuous Deployment pipeline requires more substantial investment in engineering and testing culture
- Documentation of processes is required to communicate to development, production, and testing team
- Ongoing maintanence of the pipeline is required to ensure work continues running smoothly, increase production costs
- Feature flags are required for coordination between departments

# Jenkins

Is a self-contained, open source automation server, which can be used to automate the building, testing, and deployment of software

It can installed standalone on a system, or work with tools like docker

# Jenkins Projects, Jobs, and Builds

In Jenkis you work with Projects/Jobs
- Each job is a repeatable set of steps that automate a task
- You can trigger your jobs manually, externally, or by other jobs
- When a job is triggerd it create a build

Jobs have a status called Health, the health is represented by a weather condition
- Sunny: 81% or more of builds have passed
- Partially Sunny: 61% to 80% of builds have passed
- Cloudy: 41% - 60% of your builds have passed
- Raining: 21% - 40% of your builds have passed
- Stormy: 20% or less of your builds have passed

By default this is calculated based off of the last 5 runs of your Job/Project

Builds have a more traditional status, each one gets a colored circle representing success or failure
- Blue: success
- Yellow: unstable
- Red: Failure
- Gray: No builds/aborted build

# Gradle Review

Gradle is a fast, flexible, general purpose build tool, that allows developers to build any software.

It's task and plugin model allow developers to create custom workflows, or use pre-canned workflows

Gradle scripts are written in Groovey or Kotlin which gives full java API exposure to write tasks that can perform any OS task

Gradle builds consist of one or more projects.

The definition of a project in Gradel is dependent on Gradle is being used to do.
- A project could be anything from building a JAR to testing

The work that is done in a project is performed by one or more task.

A task is a single unit of work which a build performs, this could be something as simple as compiling a class, or running a single unit test

A script is a file that the Gradle daemon looks for in the current directory. By default all Gradle configured directories have a file named `build.gradle` which is the script used for build configurations for your project

## For Project 2

1. Build your application by
- GitBash in the root directory of your project
- Run `gradle build`
- Transfer the generated jar to your EC2:

# DevOps Pipeline with Jenkins

1. SSH into the VM instance

2. Install java 8
- `sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk`

3. Install Docker
- `sudo yum install docker`
- `sudo service docker start`
- `sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}`
- `exit` and log back into the ec2

4. Run `docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 jenkins/jenkins`

5. Get the jenkins password `docker exec -t -i happy_carson cat /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword`
- Write this down, you will need it in the next step

Go to INSTANCEIP:8080 in your internet browser

6. Put in the password then setup jenkins

-   Choose install sugested plugins
-   Skip and continue as admin
-   Not now
-   Start using Jenkins

7. Create you first job

-   New Item
-   Name the build > FreeStyle Project > OK
-   Fill out the description
-   Talk through the different settings
-   Click on Build > Execute shell > echo something ls printenv
-   Apply
-   Click schedule build
-   Look at the build
-   Break the build a few times

8. Create a build triggered by build 1

-   New Item
-   Name the build > FreeStyle Project > OK
-   Go to build triggers > Build after other projects are built > Type in the name of the first job > Choose which ever option
-   Add a Build Step > Execute shell > echo I was called
-   Click save
-   Run the first project, and see that the second one is in the queue

9. Create a Github pipeline

-   Using the repo we have been using in training for SchoolManagmentBoot go to Webhooks > Add Webhook

-   Set payload URL to http://GCPIP:8080/github-webhook/

-   Set the content type to application/json

-   Choose `Let me select individual events`

    -   Pull Requests, Pushes

-   Add Webhook

-   If the delivery fails, try to fix the issue and redeliver

-   Back to Jenkins, New Item > Name it > Free Style Project > OK

-   Description > Can be literally anything

-   Source Code Management > Git > Paste the URL to the Repo

-   Branches to Build > \*/main

-   Build triggers > Github hook trigger for GitScm polling

-   Build > Add Build Step > Execute Shell

10. Setting up the Execute Shell

-   Start with `ls` to see the package structure from github

-   ```
    ls
    chmod 777 gradlew
    ./gradlew build
    ```

11. After the build succeeds we will put the project on the compute engine instance, since our docker container should be just for running jenkins

-   Run `docker exec -t -i mycontainer /bin/bash` to explore the file system of our container

-   Run `docker cp busy_hellman:/var/jenkins_home/workspace/Speedrun ~/demo`

12. Now we should be able to run our application with
- `java -jar project.jar`
